00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.718
They say, if you wanna
tell a story right,

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.106
you gotta start
at the beginning.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.214
Too far? Fine.

00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:43.737
This is me, Harleen Quinzel.

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:46.761
When I was a kid, my dad
traded me for a six-pack of beer.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.617
But however many times
he tried to ditch me...

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:51.308
- Daddy!
- ...I kept coming back.

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:53.705
Eventually,
he found me a new home.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.262
The good sisters of St.
Bernadette's taught me a lot.

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:02.141
But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.789
All things considered, I did good.
I even went to college.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.730
Got my PhD.
Had my heart broken once or twice.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.784
Finding love, it's not easy.

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.704
So I threw myself into my work,
became a psychiatrist.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:20.564
That's when I met him.
Mr. J. My Joker.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.764
Oh, I fell hard. Like out
of a plane without a parachute,

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:26.860
right in your dumb
fucking face kinda hard.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.779
I lost all sense of who I was.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.845
I only had eyes for Puddin'.
We all know the saying,

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:37.724
"Behind every successful man
"there's a badass broad."

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:40.873
Well, that was me.
I was the brains behind some of

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:44.516
Mr. J's greatest stunts.
Not that he let anyone know it.

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:45.310
Puddin'?

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:49.193
I guess all good things
have to come to an end.

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:50.969
So...

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.851
...we broke up.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.743
I handled it real mature.

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:03.227
But Mr. J was
super broke up about it.

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:11.244
I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:15.883
It gave me the space
to really reflect

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:18.271
on the mistakes of my past.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:25.235
I had to find a new identity.

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:27.615
A new me.

00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:34.889
It wasn't easy. But after a while,
I even opened myself up

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.247
to the possibility
of new love.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.724
Hi. Hello, nice baby.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.354
- Here's the thing about new love...
- I take payment-in-kind.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.200
...you have to feed it.

00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:07.898
Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:11.849
Ready to move on,
to make new friends.

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.821
She means fucking business!

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:15.968
- Oh, here we go!
- Whip me!

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:19.856
She has taken a whip from the
pivot, catapulted to the high side!

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:22.027
Oh!

00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:31.472
Yeah! Come on!

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:35.465
It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:37.997
so I really
put myself out there.

00:03:38.077 --> 00:03:41.397
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

00:03:46.054 --> 00:03:48.924
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.216
- What?
- I said...

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.950
Sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.031
Okay.

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:01.822
You broke my fucking legs!

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.904
Oh, boo-hoo.

00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:08.941
What?

00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:12.324
It's not a party without
a little drama, am I right?

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.873
Come on! Turn it up!

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:17.011
Shots on the house.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:21.035
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.445
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.998
- That was my driver.
- Oh, whoops.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.021
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.917
Consider me grateful. Especially
since I know you don't like me.

00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:34.912
I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.

00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:37.967
That and his obsessive-compulsive
need to be the center of attention.

00:04:38.047 --> 00:04:40.449
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:44.443
Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.007
Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.969
Okay, fine, so I hadn't
told people about the breakup.

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:54.044
- But you don't understand.
- Find me a new driver.

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:57.527
Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.

00:04:58.034 --> 00:05:01.905
I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:05.325
and no one
ever dared to object.

00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:22.393
And don't let him give you shit, okay?
You have to stick up for yourself.

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.881
Oh, please. I give it a few days
before they're back together.

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.874
Even when I did try and tell
people, they didn't believe me.

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:50.876
Come on. She told me they're
really broken up this time.

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:54.515
Sure they are, Shell. That's why she's
still wearing that tacky "J" necklace.

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:59.946
She is going to be running right back into
his arms the minute he snaps his fingers.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.033
If not him, the next closest
alpha male with a pulse.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:06.105
Some people just aren't
born to stand on their own.

00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:08.038
- Oh, girl, let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.967
I knew I needed to find
some way to show the world

00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:14.043
that I'd cut ties with Mr. J
for good.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.125
Harley!

00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:20.676
Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.

00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:24.046
The Joker and I?
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic

00:06:24.287 --> 00:06:26.676
industrial processing plant.

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:36.536
And luckily for me,
I have all my best ideas drunk.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.768
I have the best idea!

00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:51.588
The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:04.463
This is
where it all began, Puddin'.

00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:07.581
You motherfucker!

00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:36.680
It was the closure I needed.

00:07:37.072 --> 00:07:40.589
A fresh start.
A chance to be my own woman.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:57.163
But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.

00:07:58.216 --> 00:08:01.473
This is our story.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:06.499
And I'm telling it,
so I'll start where I fucking want.

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:11.148
- Meet the cop.
- I got 50 says it was turf war.

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:14.108
- Not him.
- Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.

00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:16.384
Her. Renee Montoya.

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:20.010
Raised on '80s cop shows,
she's always saying cheesy shit like...

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.117
There was only one shooter.
Inside.

00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:27.141
This guy shot out the glass.
Serrano.

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:29.223
Yo. Hey.

00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.198
Have Ballistics check for a bullet
in one of those parked cars.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.210
Ten years ago, she broke
a career-making case.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.160
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.080
But her partner at the time
took all the credit.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.740
So while he made captain, she got stuck
at detective level with this idiot.

00:08:44.132 --> 00:08:47.065
- Okay, you think one guy got all four?
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:49.140
I'm just saying, we got four
dead bodies here, you know.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.257
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:54.594
I'm sorry.
Go ahead and work. Go ahead.

00:08:59.146 --> 00:09:02.130
The shooter got close
before drawing. Six rounds.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.164
- Two for each of these three.
- Yo, mind your debt.

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:07.771
I'm telling you.
That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:11.246
- Look at this. Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:24.609
And it wasn't about them.

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:28.561
It was all about this guy,
right here.

00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:34.587
Do you know who I am?

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.590
You fucking bitch.

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:49.580
And this arrow through his throat...

00:09:51.233 --> 00:09:53.270
She wanted him to die slowly.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.773
- She?
- We got a hair.

00:09:56.322 --> 00:10:00.286
- And he's got a new assassin.
- Who does?

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:03.310
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.240
Jesus Christ.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.701
This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?

00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:12.336
Shit.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.154
Wow.

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:18.627
Detective.
Found this necklace.

00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:22.334
Holy shit.

00:10:23.231 --> 00:10:25.233
Good work, Officer.

00:10:25.337 --> 00:10:27.339
What is it?

00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:32.190
- Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.
- What?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.371
This was their spot. She just publicly
updated her relationship status.

00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:41.209
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.148
She did not
think this one through.

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:45.379
Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:49.372
I'm about to learn that a lot of
people in this city want me dead.

00:10:49.452 --> 00:10:53.658
And at the top of that list
is this guy.

00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:57.818
Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.

00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:02.854
You kinda forced my hand here.
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.673
I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.402
And I thought... Shh!

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:18.262
I thought we could build
something beautiful together.

00:11:18.342 --> 00:11:20.660
I thought we could be family.

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:35.872
I'm gonna set you free.

00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:39.308
Mmm...

00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:43.879
What about her?

00:11:48.888 --> 00:11:50.653
I think we can let her go.

00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:53.773
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

00:11:58.523 --> 00:12:01.405
Baby. Aww.

00:12:01.485 --> 00:12:03.699
Don't cry.

00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:07.922
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:10.316
You're welcome.

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:13.310
Is that a snot bubble?

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.427
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

00:12:15.507 --> 00:12:17.899
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

00:12:18.406 --> 00:12:20.408
No. No!

00:12:22.336 --> 00:12:26.406
The wack job with the penchant
for peeling faces is Roman Sionis,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.878
aka Black Mask.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:36.300
The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.959
See, I was halfway across town,

00:12:39.352 --> 00:12:42.922
hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:48.906
Egg, bacon, American cheese.

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:54.306
Soft, toasted buttered roll.

00:12:54.386 --> 00:12:56.464
Just a dash of hot sauce.

00:12:56.544 --> 00:13:00.426
Not too much, Sal.
I wanna taste the cheese.

00:13:00.506 --> 00:13:03.868
What a way to
start my new life.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.986
With the perfect egg sandwich.

00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:11.495
Mmm!

00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:13.939
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.861
And I'm good for the 75 cents,
okay? I promise.

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:24.865
That's all the money I got
in the world, and it's so worth it.

00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:30.525
I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,

00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:34.415
or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,

00:13:34.495 --> 00:13:38.355
but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.828
I mean it, Sal. No one.

00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:57.950
Freeze! Gotham PD.

00:13:57.965 --> 00:14:00.736
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:14:01.004 --> 00:14:03.396
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.466
Yo! Police.

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:12.449
It had been six short hours
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:16.515
announced to the world
that Mr. J and I were dunzo.

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:20.937
The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.

00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:24.397
Cops who never would've dared
come after me before

00:14:24.477 --> 00:14:26.848
were suddenly doing this.

00:14:33.165 --> 00:14:35.417
- Ooh!
- Freeze!

00:14:35.498 --> 00:14:39.067
And what's worse? Every person
I ever wronged now felt free

00:14:39.438 --> 00:14:41.440
to come and
take their pound of flesh.

00:14:57.631 --> 00:15:01.013
Turns out
I wronged a lot of people.

00:15:02.657 --> 00:15:05.935
Come on, boy. Get him!

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.672
Oh...

00:15:22.644 --> 00:15:24.646
Finally.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.637
- And then...
- We're gonna get through this, okay?

00:15:35.717 --> 00:15:37.963
...tragedy struck.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:52.232
It took losing
something I truly love

00:15:52.248 --> 00:15:55.435
for me to see that
the target on my back

00:15:55.527 --> 00:15:57.529
was bigger than I thought.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.576
Freeze!

00:15:59.656 --> 00:16:02.200
With the walls
closing in around me,

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:06.927
I made a carefully calculated,
highly strategic move.

00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:18.489
Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...

00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:20.571
That felt pretty great.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.454
Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.

00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:29.676
- See ya. Oh!
- There she is.

00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:32.825
- Harley Quinn.
- Yeah?

00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:37.568
- I've waited a long time for this.
- You have?

00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:41.124
Oh... I haven't had breakfast yet.

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:46.003
- What did I do to you?
- Are you serious?

00:16:46.688 --> 00:16:48.690
Look at my face.

00:16:48.773 --> 00:16:51.988
Look at my face!

00:16:57.645 --> 00:16:59.647
Oh...

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:03.223
- That wasn't me.
- But you dared him to do it.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.887
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:08.669
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:13.576
That means there's
no one here to stop me.

00:17:14.754 --> 00:17:16.610
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.792
Ooh. A penny.

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:26.008
They're shooting arrows now?

00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:38.282
Ah, crap. Him, too?

00:17:48.722 --> 00:17:50.724
Parley?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.650
Fuck, Montoya, you smell
like a dead rat's asshole.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.189
- Not today, Simpson.
- Hey, it's Detective Montoya.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.623
Respect your elders.
I mean, your elderly.

00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:04.771
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

00:18:04.851 --> 00:18:06.626
You wanna go there?

00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:08.660
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.766
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

00:18:10.846 --> 00:18:14.249
Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.

00:18:15.726 --> 00:18:17.727
What? No comeback?

00:18:20.688 --> 00:18:22.690
You all right?

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:25.134
You smell like shit.

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:29.675
Yo, Simpson.

00:18:29.768 --> 00:18:32.191
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

00:18:34.658 --> 00:18:38.176
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

00:18:38.661 --> 00:18:41.699
The Sionis family name is on half
the museums and schools in Gotham.

00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:44.275
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.756
Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.280
Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?

00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:53.679
That's him. He had four people
killed alone last night.

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:57.703
If Sionis is such a mastermind, how'd he
get fired from his own fucking company?

00:18:57.783 --> 00:19:00.716
The Janus Corporation
is his father's company, thank you.

00:19:00.796 --> 00:19:02.812
And by the way,
they cut him off.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.710
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.765
To make matters worse, the assistant DA?
That's her ex.

00:19:08.845 --> 00:19:11.309
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

00:19:11.702 --> 00:19:13.729
There's a shipment coming in.

00:19:13.811 --> 00:19:15.771
- Drugs?
- A diamond.

00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:18.004
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:20.307
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:23.674
His driver. He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

00:19:23.754 --> 00:19:25.780
And he said that he overheard
something about laser-encoding.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.836
Now, I did some research.
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:32.776
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

00:19:32.856 --> 00:19:36.633
Quick history lesson. Fifteen years
ago, one of the wealthiest

00:19:36.713 --> 00:19:38.823
Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.

00:19:38.903 --> 00:19:41.732
It was a power grab,
but the real target

00:19:41.812 --> 00:19:46.019
was the Bertinellis' super-secret
offshore bank accounts,

00:19:46.024 --> 00:19:49.163
the details of which were said
to be encoded in the atomic structure

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:53.669
of a 30-carat diamond.
The rock was lost.

00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:56.745
And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.

00:19:56.825 --> 00:20:01.344
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

00:20:01.777 --> 00:20:04.856
That's what makes him so dangerous.
He's already building an army.

00:20:04.936 --> 00:20:07.839
If he gets the diamond, he'll
have all the money and connections

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:12.697
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:17.368
- You said you had someone on the inside?
- Yes. He's...

00:20:17.938 --> 00:20:21.684
- He's no longer there, but...
- So basically, you have nothing.

00:20:21.764 --> 00:20:23.759
You are trying to go after

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:26.720
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.753
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:32.756
Well, you know, the DA's office
is building a case against him, too.

00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:35.874
- Isn't that right, Miss Yee?
- If the DA is willing to throw himself

00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:39.857
- out in front of this, it's fine with me.
- Captain, no.

00:20:39.937 --> 00:20:44.393
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.738
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

00:20:46.818 --> 00:20:49.834
This is my case, okay? I've been
working on this for six months.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:54.235
We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.

00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:56.817
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

00:21:00.565 --> 00:21:02.732
Look, I'm sorry about
that, but I...

00:21:02.812 --> 00:21:05.797
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

00:21:05.877 --> 00:21:08.368
- Me? He gave my case away.
- Oh, poor Renee.

00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:10.739
Why don't you pour yourself
a drink? It's almost noon.

00:21:10.819 --> 00:21:12.821
Wow.

00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:17.745
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

00:21:17.825 --> 00:21:20.758
Why the fuck haven't you been picking
up your phone? We've got a situation.

00:21:20.838 --> 00:21:23.740
- What... What situation?
- You didn't hear this from me,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.805
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:27.900
She's got the diamond, and
trust me, Roman will kill her.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.850
- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
- This kid.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.885
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

00:21:33.965 --> 00:21:36.346
Holy fuck.

00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:48.970
- Can I help you?
- Why, yes. Yes, you can.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.224
I'm here to
report a terrible crime.

00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:55.446
And what terrible crime is that?

00:21:57.902 --> 00:21:59.904
This one.

00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:18.269
Hi, boys.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.927
Meeting's over.

00:23:22.926 --> 00:23:25.319
Run, piggy, run.

00:23:33.018 --> 00:23:35.020
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:40.893
Hold up, hold up. I'm telling
this all wrong. Let's rewind.

00:23:40.974 --> 00:23:43.969
For you to understand why me,
the cop, and that dame on the toilet...

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:45.043
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:47.984
...are all looking for
this Cain character.

00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:50.487
I gotta take you back
a few days,

00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:54.449
to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.

00:23:56.988 --> 00:24:02.373
This is a man's world

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.545
This is a man's world...

00:24:09.937 --> 00:24:13.549
- This is Dinah Lance.
- But it would be nothing

00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:18.553
- But she prefers Black Canary.
- Nothing...

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.931
- She's got a killer voice.
- Without a woman or a girl...

00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:25.069
But there was some other shit
going down that night.

00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:26.956
...short notice like this.

00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:29.062
I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.

00:24:29.142 --> 00:24:33.557
I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:37.101
The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.

00:24:37.181 --> 00:24:41.574
I can.
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:44.931
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:48.027
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.

00:24:48.107 --> 00:24:51.081
I'm building something special.

00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:53.980
I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.056
But with all due respect,

00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:59.528
the Golden Lions
are a family business.

00:25:00.003 --> 00:25:03.040
Fuck family. All due respect,
but fuck that.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.013
Family's a fucking illusion. You know
what my family gave me? Nothing.

00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:10.119
I know what everyone says.
"Here comes Roman Sionis.

00:25:10.199 --> 00:25:12.623
"He was handed life
on a silver spoon."

00:25:13.015 --> 00:25:14.958
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:17.575
Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.

00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:21.631
But look at me now.

00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:26.082
I've located the Bertinelli diamond.
I'm about to own this city.

00:25:26.162 --> 00:25:30.054
Not just the East End.
I am thinking big, baby.

00:25:30.134 --> 00:25:35.080
And I want you there with me.
We could make our own family.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.988
Mr. Sionis,
the Golden Lions have operated

00:25:38.068 --> 00:25:40.070
in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:43.628
We have no need
of your protection.

00:25:44.115 --> 00:25:46.579
He's gonna regret that.

00:25:55.104 --> 00:25:57.181
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:59.110
Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.999
and I'll come see you at
the docks, day after tomorrow.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:04.081
Okay?

00:26:10.096 --> 00:26:14.187
This is a man's world

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:16.991
It would be nothing

00:26:17.071 --> 00:26:19.073
Without a woman or a girl...

00:26:20.157 --> 00:26:23.038
Who's having a good time?
You are.

00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:26.040
- Lost in the wilderness...
- Food is good?

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.148
- Do you need any more cocktails?
- Lost in the bitterness...

00:26:29.228 --> 00:26:33.621
- Your good health.
- He's lost in the loneliness...

00:26:34.285 --> 00:26:37.082
He's lost

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:40.638
This is a man's world

00:26:41.114 --> 00:26:43.713
It wouldn't be nothing

00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:57.496
Without a woman or a girl

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:02.167
Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.

00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:05.169
- Come on!
- He calls her his little bird,

00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:09.580
and he's got her wrapped
right around his fancy little finger.

00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:17.281
- Here you go, Canary.
- Thank you.

00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:20.705
How do you spell "mercenary"?

00:27:21.285 --> 00:27:23.520
Merceninny...

00:27:24.204 --> 00:27:26.206
Merceran?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.247
Singer lady woman!

00:27:34.327 --> 00:27:37.188
You're really, really good.

00:27:37.268 --> 00:27:39.270
Yeah.

00:27:44.294 --> 00:27:46.769
Know what a harlequin is?

00:27:49.164 --> 00:27:51.293
Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?

00:27:51.374 --> 00:27:53.254
Oof!

00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:55.579
Ouch!

00:27:58.339 --> 00:28:01.565
A harlequin's role

00:28:02.258 --> 00:28:04.608
is to serve.

00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:07.121
An audience.

00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:09.582
A master.

00:28:11.391 --> 00:28:15.566
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

00:28:17.231 --> 00:28:21.801
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

00:28:30.388 --> 00:28:34.360
Yeah, I don't know who you think
I am, lady, but I'm not her.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.671
Puddin' and I broke up.

00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:48.617
I haven't told that to anyone.

00:28:49.342 --> 00:28:51.295
Yeah.

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.704
For good this time.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.803
And for the first time
in a long time,

00:29:00.237 --> 00:29:02.660
I'm all on my lonesome.

00:29:07.202 --> 00:29:09.204
It's great.

00:29:11.445 --> 00:29:13.764
Welcome to the club.

00:29:14.438 --> 00:29:16.318
Thanks.

00:29:16.398 --> 00:29:20.332
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

00:29:20.412 --> 00:29:22.292
- Yes!
- Yeah?

00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:24.179
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:26.724
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

00:29:29.357 --> 00:29:31.359
Hey.

00:29:40.398 --> 00:29:42.842
We're all good here.

00:29:56.246 --> 00:29:58.334
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:00.681
No.

00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.351
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:07.290
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.293
- Are we getting breakfast?
- Hey, buddy, I'm gonna need some help.

00:30:10.373 --> 00:30:13.233
This is my friend.
I told you all about...

00:30:13.314 --> 00:30:16.821
- Hey, get the door, man. There we go.
- Wait.

00:30:17.421 --> 00:30:20.209
- Isn't that Joker's girl?
- Not anymore.

00:30:20.289 --> 00:30:23.304
- Got room for one more?
- Hey.

00:30:23.385 --> 00:30:25.386
Huh?

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.823
I don't need your help.
I got this.

00:30:31.372 --> 00:30:33.784
You got this?
You sure about that?

00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:36.313
Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.

00:30:39.347 --> 00:30:41.708
Uh...

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:53.370
You got this!

00:30:54.308 --> 00:30:56.773
You motherfucker!

00:30:58.385 --> 00:31:00.387
Whoo!

00:31:03.358 --> 00:31:05.907
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

00:31:06.444 --> 00:31:09.430
Could that be
our little Miss Lance?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.257
All these years,
I thought she was just a pretty face

00:31:12.338 --> 00:31:14.728
and a fine set of lungs.

00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.353
Ooh.

00:31:17.433 --> 00:31:21.900
Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.

00:31:29.517 --> 00:31:31.867
That's my little bird.

00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:37.945
Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.391
Shut up.

00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:43.889
Oh, songbird.

00:31:44.457 --> 00:31:46.828
You drive
as good as you fight?

00:31:49.368 --> 00:31:52.353
- Who's asking?
- The boss.

00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:54.435
You're getting promoted.

00:31:56.593 --> 00:31:59.379
- You're his new driver.
- Huh. Thanks,

00:31:59.461 --> 00:32:02.393
but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.

00:32:02.473 --> 00:32:04.834
You'll be good
at the driving gig.

00:32:05.508 --> 00:32:09.515
Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:12.413
So, that's how Canary
got herself a job

00:32:12.493 --> 00:32:14.978
driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.

00:32:15.548 --> 00:32:18.502
A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant

00:32:18.582 --> 00:32:21.871
without the help of yours truly.

00:32:28.581 --> 00:32:30.582
Morning.

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:44.911
- You're the one who wanted the kid!
- I never wanted her!

00:32:46.618 --> 00:32:48.915
Let me guess. Parents?

00:32:49.484 --> 00:32:52.479
- Foster parents.
- Right.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:54.512
Sorry, kid.

00:32:54.592 --> 00:32:57.025
Sorry about your face.

00:32:57.532 --> 00:33:00.361
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:03.906
You should've seen
the other guy.

00:33:05.644 --> 00:33:07.513
Uh...

00:33:07.593 --> 00:33:10.370
I want that kid out
of my fucking house!

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.935
You know, kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.

00:33:13.547 --> 00:33:15.938
You just gotta hang in there.

00:33:21.595 --> 00:33:23.862
Get something to eat.

00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:27.939
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

00:33:36.546 --> 00:33:38.548
Don't talk to me like that.

00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:42.409
Canary spends the next week

00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:46.028
settling in to her new job
as Roman's personal driver.

00:33:54.677 --> 00:33:56.567
Ew. Okay.

00:33:56.647 --> 00:33:59.612
What she didn't know is that
driving Mr. Face-peely-pants

00:33:59.692 --> 00:34:02.469
was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:05.024
of my favorite little piggy.

00:34:05.593 --> 00:34:08.422
- Dinah Lance?
- Who the hell are you?

00:34:08.502 --> 00:34:11.967
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

00:34:14.497 --> 00:34:18.025
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.557
Oh, really?

00:34:19.637 --> 00:34:23.999
He told me that there was a
shipment coming in. A diamond.

00:34:24.485 --> 00:34:26.487
A very special diamond.

00:34:27.592 --> 00:34:30.974
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

00:34:32.597 --> 00:34:34.598
Do you know
who you're working for?

00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:38.543
Damn right, I do. He's the man who
gave me a job. Took me off the streets.

00:34:38.623 --> 00:34:41.503
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

00:34:41.584 --> 00:34:44.464
A criminal. A murderer.

00:34:44.544 --> 00:34:47.568
What would your mother think of you
working for a guy like that, huh?

00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:51.659
You have the same power she had. Don't
you think she would want you to use it?

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.639
The hell do you know
about my mother?

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.673
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

00:34:56.753 --> 00:34:59.134
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

00:34:59.652 --> 00:35:01.657
She was a damn good woman.

00:35:01.737 --> 00:35:05.922
The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.

00:35:06.533 --> 00:35:08.632
And when she was found
dead in the street,

00:35:08.712 --> 00:35:12.136
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:16.670
Now you wanna come and knock on
my door and ask me to help you out

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.132
and make
the same mistake she did?

00:35:20.713 --> 00:35:24.032
Yeah. Good luck with that.

00:35:24.757 --> 00:35:29.130
That's fair enough.
And I'm sorry for your loss.

00:35:30.585 --> 00:35:32.587
For the record,

00:35:32.723 --> 00:35:36.188
that would never happen
on my watch.

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:41.173
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:44.155
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

00:35:44.547 --> 00:35:46.980
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:51.577
It sure did, boss.
It sure fucking did.

00:35:51.657 --> 00:35:54.132
Crossbow Killer

00:35:54.753 --> 00:35:58.698
struck again last night.
Rossi and four of his guys.

00:35:58.778 --> 00:36:01.700
People don't kill people I own
without my permission.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.702
Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?

00:36:03.782 --> 00:36:05.611
- You know that!
- I know it.

00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:08.644
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?

00:36:08.725 --> 00:36:11.168
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

00:36:11.768 --> 00:36:13.711
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:15.672
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

00:36:15.752 --> 00:36:18.580
We're just finishing up a
little business. Look around.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.613
- You're late.
- It's fine.

00:36:20.693 --> 00:36:22.605
Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?

00:36:22.685 --> 00:36:25.045
No. Isn't this stunning?

00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:29.236
That is a Chokwe mask.

00:36:29.753 --> 00:36:32.645
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

00:36:32.725 --> 00:36:34.689
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:37.524
I've never been.
I've heard it's beautiful.

00:36:37.604 --> 00:36:42.737
It's dirty. Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:46.553
Shuar of Ecuador. They're
amazing people. Surprisingly gentle.

00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:48.576
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

00:36:48.656 --> 00:36:52.621
They boil the heads of their enemies
and they make these little fellas.

00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:54.592
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:36:54.672 --> 00:36:57.667
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

00:36:57.747 --> 00:36:59.658
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:01.608
And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.

00:37:01.688 --> 00:37:03.662
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.611
These are
ancient acupuncture models.

00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:07.790
As you can see, they have
all the acupuncture points.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.273
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:14.609
Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:18.103
All right, all right, let's find
the Crossbow Killer. I get it.

00:37:18.662 --> 00:37:21.720
- Is he an acupuncture model, too?
- He is not an acupuncture model.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.796
This is a statue of me. It was made
by a very famous Gotham artist...

00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:27.195
Harley Quinn did it.

00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:30.270
Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.

00:37:30.787 --> 00:37:32.789
They split.

00:37:32.893 --> 00:37:35.223
What's wrong with you, Victor?

00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:38.746
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

00:37:38.826 --> 00:37:41.300
This is spectacular news!

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:44.283
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

00:37:44.674 --> 00:37:47.733
Have the boys go find her. Round her up,
bring her back. I want her.

00:37:47.813 --> 00:37:49.745
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:52.290
Something super-duper
important, okay?

00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:54.552
- I'll go with you.
- Yeah, go with Victor.

00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:56.814
- It's just a pickup.
- No, he's harmless.

00:37:56.894 --> 00:37:59.244
Do as you're told. Go.

00:38:13.773 --> 00:38:16.780
- All right. We can go.
- I'll take that.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.739
- Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.
- Go get your car.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.840
That rock. That rock's
about to become the key

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.188
to whether or not I live to
enjoy my newfound independence.

00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:36.683
- Get off me.
- What the hell are you doing here?

00:38:36.763 --> 00:38:40.172
You're not the only one who makes
money off of dumb, rich, white people.

00:38:40.253 --> 00:38:43.731
Well, you know what? One day you're
gonna pick the wrong pocket, sis.

00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:46.244
Okay. Whatever.

00:38:48.857 --> 00:38:51.238
Dumb-ass kids.

00:38:52.839 --> 00:38:55.169
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:08.274
- I really like your earrings.
- Why, thank you.

00:39:09.824 --> 00:39:12.153
There's the thief.
There's the thief.

00:39:13.942 --> 00:39:17.835
- Get off of me!
- That little girl took my watch.

00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:20.233
I didn't do nothing.

00:39:22.783 --> 00:39:25.769
Where the fuck's the diamond?
I just fucking had it.

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:27.851
Cass!

00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:30.710
Wait!

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.792
Wait, wait!

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.756
Halt!

00:39:34.836 --> 00:39:36.838
Fuck!

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.893
In the storytelling business,
this dummy swallowing that diamond

00:40:00.973 --> 00:40:03.964
is called a complication.

00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:09.203
A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.

00:40:11.805 --> 00:40:13.807
Parley?

00:40:15.903 --> 00:40:18.888
- We lost the diamond.
- What?

00:40:18.968 --> 00:40:20.858
We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...

00:40:20.938 --> 00:40:23.372
We never even
got our hands on it.

00:40:24.828 --> 00:40:26.759
Ow!

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:28.813
Help!

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:32.017
Get out! Get out of here!
You, too! Go!

00:40:32.098 --> 00:40:35.383
With your fucking sage
stinking my place up. Fuck off!

00:40:35.816 --> 00:40:37.977
- Here she is.
- She's a child!

00:40:38.057 --> 00:40:40.793
- She's just a kid.
- She's... What?

00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.899
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:45.922
Fuck off! Get out.
Fucking out!

00:40:46.003 --> 00:40:49.759
Fuck! These are my things.
This diamond is my things.

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:52.866
My things! Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

00:40:52.946 --> 00:40:54.784
- No.
- Why is this happening to me?

00:40:54.864 --> 00:40:56.866
Why?

00:40:57.836 --> 00:41:01.906
I'm gonna get your diamond back.
I promise.

00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:07.339
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

00:41:08.053 --> 00:41:10.414
Blow off a little steam.

00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:13.489
Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.

00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:18.380
Okay. I'll go get changed.

00:41:33.087 --> 00:41:35.374
Shit, Cass.

00:41:40.061 --> 00:41:43.485
I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.

00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:45.913
We're working on it.

00:41:45.993 --> 00:41:49.282
Now, let's go have a little fun.

00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:58.049
Harleen Quinzel.

00:41:58.129 --> 00:42:00.131
Whoo!

00:42:01.007 --> 00:42:03.008
Hiya, Romy.

00:42:03.926 --> 00:42:05.983
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

00:42:06.063 --> 00:42:07.975
When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,

00:42:08.055 --> 00:42:10.467
there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.

00:42:10.954 --> 00:42:13.865
Breaking his driver's legs. There's
that time I called it an "expresso."

00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.410
Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.

00:42:20.129 --> 00:42:22.998
Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.

00:42:23.078 --> 00:42:25.333
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

00:42:25.432 --> 00:42:29.067
You're gonna do that thing where you open
up a weird-ass case of torture devices

00:42:29.147 --> 00:42:33.039
while inexplicably detailing your
master plan and how I don't fit into it.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:36.052
- I'm building a better...
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!

00:42:36.132 --> 00:42:39.355
You're building a criminal empire because
Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp.

00:42:39.392 --> 00:42:41.025
And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality

00:42:41.106 --> 00:42:43.016
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

00:42:43.096 --> 00:42:46.895
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

00:42:46.975 --> 00:42:48.918
And you're really not as
clever as you think, because

00:42:48.998 --> 00:42:50.971
- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.

00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:54.119
Now you're gonna say that you
wanna kill me to set an example.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.492
- Christ, you're boring.
- I wanna kill you...

00:42:57.573 --> 00:43:00.471
- Shit.
- ...because without the Joker around,

00:43:01.988 --> 00:43:03.990
I can.

00:43:06.138 --> 00:43:10.948
For all your noise and bluster,
you're just a silly little girl

00:43:11.028 --> 00:43:13.690
with no one around
to protect her.

00:43:17.578 --> 00:43:19.281
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

00:43:19.368 --> 00:43:21.019
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:24.919
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.
Come on. There's gotta be something,

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:27.001
something we can figure out.
Hey!

00:43:27.116 --> 00:43:29.120
Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?

00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:33.069
You lost something.
I heard you say it. A diamond.

00:43:37.979 --> 00:43:39.981
Yeah.

00:43:40.127 --> 00:43:42.122
I can help you find it.

00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:45.594
Seriously. Look in my pocket.

00:43:48.989 --> 00:43:50.991
Other pocket.

00:43:59.133 --> 00:44:01.055
I'm starting up
my own business.

00:44:01.135 --> 00:44:03.137
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:09.522
I know the East End
better than anybody.

00:44:10.133 --> 00:44:13.066
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:16.944
Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:44:17.024 --> 00:44:19.061
and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.

00:44:19.141 --> 00:44:21.125
If you let me go,

00:44:21.205 --> 00:44:25.129
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

00:44:25.209 --> 00:44:27.632
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

00:44:28.024 --> 00:44:29.575
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.073
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

00:44:32.153 --> 00:44:34.155
You're so tiresome!

00:44:35.145 --> 00:44:40.142
If you want my mercy, shut that hole
in the middle of your face and listen.

00:44:40.222 --> 00:44:43.511
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

00:44:49.137 --> 00:44:54.040
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:57.680
But diamonds are
a girl's best friend

00:44:59.073 --> 00:45:01.203
A kiss may be grand

00:45:01.283 --> 00:45:05.666
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat

00:45:06.058 --> 00:45:08.680
Or help you at the automat

00:45:11.146 --> 00:45:13.067
Diamonds

00:45:13.148 --> 00:45:14.089
I will be waiting.

00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:15.121
Diamonds

00:45:15.201 --> 00:45:16.164
Diamonds

00:45:16.244 --> 00:45:18.083
The diamond.

00:45:18.163 --> 00:45:19.156
Diamonds

00:45:19.236 --> 00:45:21.231
Romy, Roman.

00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:23.557
I will be waiting.

00:45:25.127 --> 00:45:26.183
But diamonds

00:45:26.263 --> 00:45:29.552
Diamonds are a girl's best

00:45:33.176 --> 00:45:35.579
I'll give you till midnight.

00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:39.216
And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face

00:45:39.296 --> 00:45:41.625
and pickle it.

00:45:42.153 --> 00:45:44.154
Okay?

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.246
Call me old-fashioned,
but I always thought the guy

00:45:49.326 --> 00:45:51.645
was meant to
get the girl a diamond.

00:45:56.332 --> 00:45:59.234
I won't let you down, Romy.
I promise.

00:45:59.314 --> 00:46:01.257
Let's make it half a mil.

00:46:01.337 --> 00:46:04.071
It's more fun
if she's got competition.

00:46:04.151 --> 00:46:06.752
Send it to
every mercenary in Gotham.

00:46:07.227 --> 00:46:09.191
Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.

00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:11.725
Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.

00:46:29.279 --> 00:46:32.169
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:35.131
We've got a situation.
This kid, she's got the diamond.

00:46:35.211 --> 00:46:37.122
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:39.204
Holy fuck.

00:46:42.175 --> 00:46:44.066
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

00:46:44.146 --> 00:46:46.148
Okay. Now we're good.

00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:51.287
Cell seven.

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.797
Thanks, doll. You're a peach.

00:47:00.316 --> 00:47:02.318
Hey, I know that guy.

00:47:20.396 --> 00:47:23.266
Access denied. Access denied.

00:47:23.346 --> 00:47:25.728
Access denied. Access denied.

00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:28.208
Access denied.
Access denied. Denied.

00:47:28.288 --> 00:47:31.628
Denied. Denied. Denied.
Denied. Denied. Denied.

00:47:34.304 --> 00:47:36.644
Hmm. Perfect.

00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.336
- Hold up, hold up. Remember me?
- She stole my car!

00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:56.191
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

00:47:56.271 --> 00:47:58.141
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

00:47:58.221 --> 00:48:00.164
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:02.176
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

00:48:02.256 --> 00:48:05.199
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- You're dead!

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.254
- I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!
- Hey, kid.

00:48:08.334 --> 00:48:10.371
- You're that psycho from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:13.224
- Are you Cassandra Cain?
- Yeah.

00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:27.362
I need to know where...

00:48:38.247 --> 00:48:41.302
- Hold, please.
- Harley...

00:50:01.425 --> 00:50:03.427
Hmm.

00:50:06.482 --> 00:50:08.749
I got you, you little shit.

00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:11.496
Who are you guys?

00:50:12.414 --> 00:50:14.416
Go, go, go.

00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:18.503
Keep the kid alive.

00:51:16.493 --> 00:51:18.494
Mmm!

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.582
A little help.

00:52:27.587 --> 00:52:29.589
Mmm...

00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:41.917
Does she have to keep running?

00:53:10.522 --> 00:53:13.132
Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.

00:53:15.557 --> 00:53:17.573
- You!
- You!

00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:19.951
Step away from the kid.

00:53:20.604 --> 00:53:24.423
- Drop it.
- The phone?

00:53:24.503 --> 00:53:26.505
Sure.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.601
Mmm.

00:54:00.535 --> 00:54:02.457
Whoa.

00:54:02.537 --> 00:54:06.013
Oh, good. You're awake.
Toss that for me, will ya?

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.536
What the fuck?

00:54:21.616 --> 00:54:23.517
Who did I just blow up?

00:54:23.597 --> 00:54:25.540
Either someone
who wants me dead,

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.991
or someone looking to collect the
half-million dollar reward on your head.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.503
- Half a million dollars?
- Yeah.

00:54:32.583 --> 00:54:35.090
Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?

00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.497
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

00:54:37.578 --> 00:54:40.719
- Now, uncuff me.
- Oh, sure.

00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:44.636
- As soon as you give me the diamond.
- What diamond?

00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:52.664
Fuck you!

00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:55.667
Look at me.

00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:01.561
What? I don't know
nothing about no diamond.

00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:03.646
The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,

00:55:03.726 --> 00:55:05.544
and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,

00:55:05.624 --> 00:55:09.557
all suggest that you do. Now, you
can give it to me, or I can give you

00:55:09.637 --> 00:55:12.758
to the man that diamond belongs to. But
trust me when I say, you're not gonna like

00:55:12.838 --> 00:55:15.001
what he's gonna do to ya.

00:55:15.602 --> 00:55:18.129
Now, hand it over.

00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:21.131
Yeah, not gonna happen.

00:55:22.628 --> 00:55:24.728
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

00:55:24.808 --> 00:55:27.378
- One more time.
- I can't give it to you.

00:55:27.713 --> 00:55:30.223
- Why not?
- Because I ate it, okay?

00:55:37.641 --> 00:55:39.643
Yes.

00:55:39.727 --> 00:55:42.122
What are we even doing here?

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.028
There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.

00:55:45.669 --> 00:55:47.671
This way,

00:55:47.859 --> 00:55:50.125
or this way.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.647
That's what I thought.
Also, I'm outta groceries.

00:55:58.723 --> 00:56:02.053
So, how long you been
a mercenary?

00:56:02.654 --> 00:56:04.321
Hey, where did you get...

00:56:04.383 --> 00:56:06.586
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

00:56:06.678 --> 00:56:08.569
you haven't even
thought about my left...

00:56:08.649 --> 00:56:11.051
Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.171
I'll have to learn that one.

00:56:17.802 --> 00:56:19.662
Can we get this?

00:56:19.742 --> 00:56:21.789
You're not gonna try
to run, are you?

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:24.302
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

00:56:24.694 --> 00:56:27.679
I figure I'm better off with the person
who's not gonna cut me open.

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:30.651
Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.

00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:33.175
I do not care
that you're a kid.

00:56:35.756 --> 00:56:37.758
I saw that.

00:56:37.852 --> 00:56:40.754
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

00:56:40.834 --> 00:56:44.310
I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:47.822
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

00:56:47.902 --> 00:56:52.639
How'd you do it? Come on, tell me.
Woman to woman.

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:56.674
Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.

00:56:56.754 --> 00:56:58.687
I mean, how do I be like you?

00:56:58.767 --> 00:57:02.315
Well, except for the crazy
part. But other than that.

00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:05.776
Number one, no one is like me.

00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:08.831
If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.

00:57:08.911 --> 00:57:13.710
Become a psychiatrist, work in an
asylum. Fall in love with your patient,

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.775
break said patient out of said asylum.
Begin a life of crime.

00:57:16.855 --> 00:57:18.861
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:20.821
Get arrested by the Batman.

00:57:20.901 --> 00:57:22.749
Go back to jail, get out of
jail with a bomb on your neck.

00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:24.647
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

00:57:24.727 --> 00:57:26.784
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

00:57:26.864 --> 00:57:29.173
and going out on your own.

00:57:31.733 --> 00:57:34.885
Number two...
Six bucks for tap water

00:57:34.965 --> 00:57:38.855
with a fucking cucumber stick in it?
That's crazy.

00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:42.226
I'm not shopping
at this store.

00:57:43.838 --> 00:57:47.897
I'm robbing this store.
Consider this your first lesson.

00:57:47.977 --> 00:57:51.151
Paying is for dummies.

00:57:56.871 --> 00:57:58.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:57:58.747 --> 00:58:00.749
Move it!

00:58:05.764 --> 00:58:07.766
Whoops. Ah...

00:58:08.996 --> 00:58:12.316
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

00:58:14.876 --> 00:58:16.767
Lotus flower!

00:58:16.847 --> 00:58:18.925
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

00:58:19.005 --> 00:58:21.719
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

00:58:21.799 --> 00:58:24.920
He knows everything and everyone. Nothing
happens around here, let me tell you,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.393
without Doc knowing about it.
And he happens to be the only person

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.811
who actually cares about me.

00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:33.730
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.910
She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.746
Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.

00:58:40.826 --> 00:58:42.725
So you don't have
to taste his cooking.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.345
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:50.214
- Everyone's looking for you. And you.
- We know.

00:58:50.294 --> 00:58:53.310
I'm telling you, if you want
boys to respect you,

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.760
you have to show them
that you're serious.

00:58:56.289 --> 00:58:58.805
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:01.902
Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.

00:59:02.294 --> 00:59:04.268
Shut that door. Lock it.

00:59:04.348 --> 00:59:06.802
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:20.460
This place... Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.858
...is so fucking dope.

00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:27.445
Oh, shit. Is that
a hyena in a bathtub?

00:59:27.525 --> 00:59:30.886
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.429
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

00:59:33.509 --> 00:59:37.955
Aren't you, my little baby?
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.

00:59:38.347 --> 00:59:40.348
I love you.

00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:44.491
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:49.747
Who, that? It's Cass.

00:59:51.535 --> 00:59:53.537
You're so pretty.

00:59:55.352 --> 00:59:57.354
Who's this?

00:59:57.437 --> 00:59:59.369
It's a beaver.

00:59:59.449 --> 01:00:01.451
Hmm.

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:07.784
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:11.418
What's this?

01:00:14.452 --> 01:00:16.833
It's art. Don't touch.

01:00:19.467 --> 01:00:21.472
He your ex or something?

01:00:21.552 --> 01:00:23.850
You don't know who that is?

01:00:24.576 --> 01:00:26.331
The Joker.

01:00:26.411 --> 01:00:30.490
The Clown Prince of Crime?
My former partner in madness?

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.348
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

01:00:33.428 --> 01:00:37.852
- You've never heard of him?
- Well, sounds like a dick.

01:00:40.496 --> 01:00:42.498
Huh.

01:00:51.527 --> 01:00:53.529
Milk.

01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:07.378
I'm not going soft
or nothing, but I gotta admit,

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.913
it was kinda nice
having the kid around.

01:01:20.522 --> 01:01:23.393
Give me a #32. Mild.

01:01:23.473 --> 01:01:25.864
Uh... Yeah, sure.

01:01:28.904 --> 01:01:33.683
I've been told that you know all
the scum of this disgusting city.

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.658
I need you to help me find someone.

01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:44.974
I know everybody,
apparently, except for you.

01:01:46.554 --> 01:01:49.863
- Who are you?
- They call me...

01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:52.480
H...

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.491
My bad.
I should've introduced you.

01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:56.573
I'll make it quick.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:05.481
Meet the daughter of the richest,
most powerful Mafia don in Gotham City.

01:02:05.561 --> 01:02:08.078
Helena Bertinelli.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.966
Yep, that Bertinelli.

01:02:12.536 --> 01:02:16.106
One day, she comes home to find
her whole family in the living room.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:18.500
Momma.

01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:23.978
Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.606
Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.

01:02:28.686 --> 01:02:32.986
The guy making the play
for the Bertinelli turf and fortune.

01:02:56.586 --> 01:02:59.623
When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,

01:02:59.703 --> 01:03:04.492
the big softy sneaks her outta
there and hides her away in Sicily.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:08.520
Where she is raised by his own
father and brother.

01:03:08.601 --> 01:03:10.757
Both assassins.

01:03:17.563 --> 01:03:21.957
She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.

01:03:22.588 --> 01:03:24.590
So, she starts training.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.545
When she was ready,
and by "ready" I mean

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:35.624
a badass motherfucking killing
machine, she moves back to Gotham.

01:03:35.704 --> 01:03:37.706
Starts working
on that kill list.

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:48.178
She has the murder stuff down,
but the rest?

01:03:48.569 --> 01:03:51.701
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?

01:03:51.781 --> 01:03:53.783
Still a work in progress.

01:03:55.743 --> 01:03:59.489
- Do you know who I am?
- The Crossbow Killer.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.565
- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer.

01:04:02.645 --> 01:04:06.704
- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer?

01:04:06.784 --> 01:04:08.978
They call me...

01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:15.546
- Huntress.
- She calls herself Huntress.

01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:18.111
Fucking fabulous, if you ask me.

01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:21.124
And who are you looking for?

01:04:27.594 --> 01:04:30.527
- Great club.
- Quinn got the girl.

01:04:30.607 --> 01:04:34.083
- And?
- And they disappeared.

01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:38.046
Fuck!

01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:40.773
Fuck!

01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:49.045
What is she laughing at?

01:04:50.646 --> 01:04:52.766
- Is she laughing at me?
- She is.

01:04:52.846 --> 01:04:55.216
No, she's not. She's...

01:04:55.221 --> 01:04:57.635
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

01:04:57.673 --> 01:05:01.753
- You gotta hear this. It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

01:05:01.833 --> 01:05:03.599
- Oh.
- Ooh.

01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:06.039
You're being a total kook.

01:05:06.775 --> 01:05:09.052
Get on the fucking table.

01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:13.274
This is my club. Get up now.

01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:16.059
- Okay.
- Now.

01:05:17.858 --> 01:05:20.051
Whoa.

01:05:21.757 --> 01:05:23.759
Now, dance.

01:05:28.836 --> 01:05:31.270
Dance. Dance, Erika!

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:33.663
Okay.

01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.187
This dress is fucking hideous.

01:05:44.746 --> 01:05:46.748
Take it off.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.762
Take your dress off.

01:05:51.711 --> 01:05:54.103
Get up there
and fucking cut it off her.

01:05:54.745 --> 01:05:56.740
Do it now!

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.806
Take her fucking dress off.
Just rip it off her. Hurry up!

01:06:00.886 --> 01:06:05.779
- Hurry up! Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:05.859 --> 01:06:07.861
Do it.

01:06:10.728 --> 01:06:13.328
Yeah. Beautiful.

01:06:28.838 --> 01:06:31.334
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

01:06:33.811 --> 01:06:35.785
I was just gonna
go look for the girl.

01:06:35.865 --> 01:06:38.429
Oh, no, no, no. I want you to
stay here with me.

01:06:38.483 --> 01:06:41.135
I want you to stay here
with me close.

01:06:41.745 --> 01:06:44.231
You soothe me, little bird.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.849
Oh, good. You got it.
Did you trace the messages?

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:03.716
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

01:07:03.796 --> 01:07:07.824
and then had it sent to my office.
Renee, what were you thinking?

01:07:07.904 --> 01:07:12.787
Roman is the one that put a price
on the kid's head. Okay? I had to.

01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:15.790
- I can't get into it right now...
- Renee, you need help.

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:19.761
- What are you talking about?
- She's right.

01:07:20.811 --> 01:07:24.256
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:26.748
What?

01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:29.875
I'm sorry. Okay?
You gave me no choice.

01:07:29.955 --> 01:07:32.295
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

01:07:32.843 --> 01:07:34.845
You're suspended.

01:07:35.001 --> 01:07:37.403
Your badge and your gun, now.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.878
If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:47.755
you know that
this is when shit gets real.

01:07:47.835 --> 01:07:53.376
What's the point of the badge,
when it means fuck all anyway?

01:07:55.791 --> 01:07:57.702
Right, Captain?

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:01.405
No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:08.317
Which would've had me worried,
only I had more pressing concerns.

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:12.289
And that is why you should never
partake in paying federal income taxes.

01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:14.881
Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

01:08:17.883 --> 01:08:20.921
- Thank you.
- Anyway, lesson 37.

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:23.003
Why...

01:08:23.952 --> 01:08:28.771
- You said they wouldn't find us.
- Chillax. No one knows we're here.

01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:31.431
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

01:08:31.823 --> 01:08:33.745
Okay. So they know.

01:08:33.825 --> 01:08:35.826
Let's scram.

01:08:36.994 --> 01:08:39.813
- Open the door.
- Holy back door, Beavy.

01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:41.888
This is getting outta hand.
Bruce, come here.

01:08:41.968 --> 01:08:43.970
I can hear you!
Open the door.

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.871
What is that?

01:08:46.951 --> 01:08:49.406
See you in hell, Harley!

01:08:51.944 --> 01:08:54.232
Get under the table!

01:08:55.906 --> 01:08:57.849
Bruce? Bruce!

01:08:57.929 --> 01:08:59.931
Come here! No!

01:09:09.867 --> 01:09:11.869
Bruce?

01:09:12.901 --> 01:09:15.355
Come here, boy. Bruce?

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:19.959
Bruce?

01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:22.879
Bruce?

01:09:23.879 --> 01:09:25.842
This doesn't make sense.

01:09:25.922 --> 01:09:29.961
It doesn't make sense. I don't
understand. No one knew we were here.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.328
No one knew we were here,
except...

01:09:32.929 --> 01:09:35.973
Doc. Oh, my God. Doc?

01:09:37.005 --> 01:09:39.407
Doc? Where is he?

01:09:40.905 --> 01:09:44.068
Doc?
I can't find Bruce.

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.400
I can't find him. I...

01:09:52.103 --> 01:09:53.971
No.

01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:58.028
- I'm sorry, lotus flower.
- You sold me out?

01:09:58.108 --> 01:10:01.438
Too many people offering me
too much money.

01:10:02.987 --> 01:10:05.494
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:09.830
- A really nice one.
- But, Doc,

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:11.852
it's me.

01:10:11.932 --> 01:10:13.934
It's just business.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:44.351
This next bit
ain't very pretty.

01:10:45.035 --> 01:10:47.092
- You're right.
- Harley?

01:10:47.172 --> 01:10:49.345
He's right.

01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:53.031
Business is business.

01:10:53.939 --> 01:10:55.941
I've got the kid.

01:10:56.045 --> 01:10:58.967
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:03.085
If I hand her over, I want everyone
who's after me to back off.

01:11:03.165 --> 01:11:06.912
Quinn,
bring me the rock now

01:11:06.992 --> 01:11:08.913
and I guarantee your safety.

01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:12.093
I own this town.
You'll have my protection.

01:11:12.173 --> 01:11:14.002
Fine.

01:11:14.082 --> 01:11:18.517
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

01:11:28.063 --> 01:11:30.064
Quit judging.

01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:34.193
Zsasz!

01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:44.060
Come on, kid.
Let's get you somewhere safe.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.142
We got them.

01:11:49.165 --> 01:11:51.087
Little bird!

01:11:51.167 --> 01:11:54.476
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

01:11:54.994 --> 01:11:58.574
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.082
Do we have to bring them back?

01:12:01.207 --> 01:12:04.631
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:08.088
Just bring me back my diamond.

01:12:55.088 --> 01:12:57.090
What is it?

01:12:57.205 --> 01:12:59.207
Nothing.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.140
- Pull over.
- What?

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.519
Pull the fucking car over now.

01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:21.585
I gotta take a leak.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:27.152
She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.

01:13:27.232 --> 01:13:31.698
- Are you sure?
- Your little bird's a fucking rat.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.520
You want me to kill her?

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:47.608
No. No. No.

01:13:48.105 --> 01:13:50.107
I'll come to you.

01:14:25.263 --> 01:14:27.748
I thought we were friends.
And you...

01:14:28.204 --> 01:14:31.240
You saw what it's like for me out there.
I didn't have a choice.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.702
And if you go before he gets here,
everything will be fine.

01:14:36.304 --> 01:14:38.164
Harley.

01:14:38.244 --> 01:14:40.750
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:53.184
That was fast.

01:14:55.321 --> 01:14:57.160
She's in...

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.644
- Where's Cassandra Cain?
- You? Again?

01:15:10.334 --> 01:15:13.195
- Are you drunk?
- Come on.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.277
Okay.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:38.615
Right in the tit.

01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:46.642
Where's Cassandra Cain?

01:15:47.294 --> 01:15:49.296
Cass.

01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:57.777
You killed my sandwich!

01:16:05.216 --> 01:16:07.218
Bye-bye, birdie.

01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:09.428
Ow!

01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:12.268
No fair.

01:16:12.348 --> 01:16:16.344
- Was that really necessary?
- You don't know her like I do.

01:16:16.424 --> 01:16:18.426
Cass?

01:16:22.089 --> 01:16:25.320
Oh, thank God.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:16:25.401 --> 01:16:29.269
Did she really tape you
to a damn toilet?

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.316
Hmm.

01:16:31.396 --> 01:16:33.662
This is nice.

01:16:34.273 --> 01:16:36.275
You're still conscious.

01:16:38.256 --> 01:16:42.754
You can still feel? Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:48.728
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

01:16:59.379 --> 01:17:03.240
I got one
for all the little birds

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.797
I helped fly away
from this world.

01:17:07.272 --> 01:17:09.809
I'm saving
a special spot for you.

01:17:11.286 --> 01:17:13.287
Right here.

01:17:17.416 --> 01:17:19.432
- You're gonna have to be quiet.
- Hi.

01:17:19.512 --> 01:17:21.747
What are you guys doing?

01:17:25.402 --> 01:17:28.325
Oh, I know
where the diamond is.

01:17:28.405 --> 01:17:31.798
Is that rock still inside you?

01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:36.412
Oh, God.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.322
Stop.

01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:45.455
- The hell, Zsasz?
- Cut her open.

01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:48.437
- Stop fucking around.
- You heard me.

01:17:48.517 --> 01:17:50.742
Cut her fucking open.

01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:53.943
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

01:17:54.407 --> 01:17:57.476
- You're a filthy fucking rat.
- I'm a rat?

01:17:57.556 --> 01:18:01.479
I knew you couldn't be
trusted. Roman's little bird.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.879
You little fucking bird.

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:06.943
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

01:18:08.556 --> 01:18:11.938
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

01:18:13.518 --> 01:18:16.431
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:18.275
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:18.356 --> 01:18:20.357
Prove it to me.

01:18:20.472 --> 01:18:22.948
Rip open her little tummy.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.899
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
- Now! Rip it open!

01:18:40.459 --> 01:18:42.850
You piece of shit!

01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:52.553
Freeze!

01:18:55.577 --> 01:18:57.802
Don't fucking move.

01:18:59.528 --> 01:19:01.815
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:08.473 --> 01:19:11.334
- Go get the kid.
- All right.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.463
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:17.997
Shoot them, kid.

01:19:18.389 --> 01:19:21.541
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:24.523
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

01:19:24.603 --> 01:19:26.504
Okay.

01:19:26.584 --> 01:19:28.557
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:34.445
But I know that this shit stick...
just tried to gut me.

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:36.635
And you.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.482
Thought you were different.

01:19:42.598 --> 01:19:44.813
I'm sorry, kid.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.848
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:58.345
Ooh!

01:19:58.425 --> 01:19:59.471
Ooh, I'm back.

01:19:59.551 --> 01:20:02.578
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

01:20:02.658 --> 01:20:05.413
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

01:20:05.493 --> 01:20:08.458
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

01:20:08.538 --> 01:20:10.919
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

01:20:12.448 --> 01:20:14.558
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

01:20:14.638 --> 01:20:17.601
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

01:20:17.681 --> 01:20:19.562
Yeah. To save
your own stupid skin. Huh?

01:20:19.642 --> 01:20:22.585
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

01:20:22.665 --> 01:20:26.515
- Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.
- I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

01:20:26.595 --> 01:20:28.597
Whoa.

01:20:29.578 --> 01:20:32.438
They call me...
Helena Bertinelli.

01:20:32.518 --> 01:20:35.523
For fuck's sake.
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

01:20:35.603 --> 01:20:39.945
Sheesh kebab. That is
childhood trauma, right there.

01:20:45.519 --> 01:20:47.521
I killed Galante.

01:20:51.473 --> 01:20:53.474
I killed his firing squad.

01:20:57.613 --> 01:21:00.078
I killed Victor Zsasz.

01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:07.960
And now I'm done.

01:21:09.509 --> 01:21:11.510
Bravo.

01:21:15.619 --> 01:21:17.489
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

01:21:17.569 --> 01:21:19.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21:19.696 --> 01:21:23.525
I hate to be the one to break it to
you, sweetheart, but you are not done.

01:21:23.605 --> 01:21:26.517
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

01:21:26.597 --> 01:21:28.457
Galante was working with Sionis.

01:21:28.537 --> 01:21:30.584
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

01:21:30.664 --> 01:21:33.097
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

01:21:33.635 --> 01:21:36.474
That diamond is our
only chance of stopping him.

01:21:36.554 --> 01:21:40.082
You guys.
Hey, I think you should see this.

01:21:42.403 --> 01:21:43.356
Oh.

01:21:43.436 --> 01:21:45.733
It's Sionis.

01:21:57.449 --> 01:21:59.757
We're fucked.

01:22:00.284 --> 01:22:02.286
He bought himself an army.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:12.462
They're all here for me.

01:22:13.515 --> 01:22:15.771
Aren't they?

01:22:22.325 --> 01:22:24.245
- No.
- They're not?

01:22:24.308 --> 01:22:26.211
No, they're not.

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:29.344
Do you know what that means? That means
he's not just after the kid anymore.

01:22:29.424 --> 01:22:33.473
He's after all of us. He's sure as hell
after me. I just robbed him.

01:22:33.553 --> 01:22:36.946
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

01:22:37.338 --> 01:22:40.427
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

01:22:40.507 --> 01:22:44.012
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:47.378
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:52.313
- we're gonna have to work together.
- With you?

01:22:52.393 --> 01:22:55.253
Yeah.
We're gonna work together,

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:57.335
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

01:23:00.567 --> 01:23:02.750
Okay.

01:23:03.393 --> 01:23:05.868
Yeah. Okay.

01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:11.310
- Sure.
- Yes!

01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:15.445
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.953
Will this do?

01:23:22.652 --> 01:23:25.657
No. Not at all.

01:23:27.413 --> 01:23:29.877
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

01:23:29.932 --> 01:23:33.463
That slimy jizznozzle! I can't believe
he took it all! - We're fucked.

01:23:33.544 --> 01:23:35.988
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.459
Okay.

01:23:55.407 --> 01:23:59.925
Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:04.941
I have funded you.
I've protected you.

01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:09.017
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.802
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

01:24:13.537 --> 01:24:19.046
Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

01:24:19.543 --> 01:24:23.030
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

01:24:23.421 --> 01:24:25.834
The rest you can kill.

01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:33.472
Dope.

01:24:34.473 --> 01:24:38.032
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.
Sentimental value. Try this.

01:24:40.468 --> 01:24:43.088
- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

01:24:43.138 --> 01:24:45.403
Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.

01:24:45.483 --> 01:24:47.509
We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.

01:24:47.589 --> 01:24:49.960
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:24:50.655 --> 01:24:53.504
Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

01:24:53.584 --> 01:24:57.248
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

01:24:57.297 --> 01:25:00.426
- Love this chick. She's got rage issues.
- I don't have rage issues.

01:25:00.506 --> 01:25:03.076
You know,
psychologically speaking,

01:25:03.468 --> 01:25:05.525
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

01:25:05.605 --> 01:25:06.557
Yeah.

01:25:06.637 --> 01:25:09.947
Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.

01:25:13.643 --> 01:25:15.879
Shit. Get down.

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.871
Down here!

01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:21.404
Cass!

01:25:21.484 --> 01:25:23.489
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:25:23.569 --> 01:25:25.571
Go!

01:25:29.512 --> 01:25:31.514
Holy shit!

01:25:51.636 --> 01:25:53.422
What?

01:25:53.502 --> 01:25:55.466
You are so cool.

01:25:55.546 --> 01:25:57.547
Okay. This way.

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:07.629
Get ready, ladies.

01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:20.603
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.
Okay? Okay.

01:26:20.683 --> 01:26:23.678
What the... Go! Go, go, go!

01:26:23.758 --> 01:26:25.760
Fuck.

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:29.618
Shit.

01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:40.617
Whoa. Shit!

01:26:59.582 --> 01:27:01.584
Motherfucker.

01:27:13.741 --> 01:27:15.693
Let me go!

01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:18.050
Gotcha.

01:27:18.703 --> 01:27:19.666
This way!

01:27:19.746 --> 01:27:21.595
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.

01:27:21.675 --> 01:27:23.617
You shouldn't
have to see this.

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:26.589
Here, hold on to this for me, okay?
That's all you think about.

01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:28.671
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:32.053
Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.

01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:15.733
Canary!

01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:18.552
You okay?

01:28:18.632 --> 01:28:20.633
We gotta go this way!

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:23.629
Ugh. More?

01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:26.273
When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?

01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:27.955
Come on.

01:28:33.812 --> 01:28:35.814
Thanks.

01:28:48.722 --> 01:28:50.723
Duck!

01:28:53.819 --> 01:28:55.814
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

01:28:55.894 --> 01:28:58.067
Ah, fuck!

01:29:02.702 --> 01:29:04.704
I got him!

01:29:06.873 --> 01:29:08.875
Get back here, kid!

01:29:11.908 --> 01:29:14.123
Who's got the kid?

01:29:26.682 --> 01:29:28.684
Get down!

01:29:37.817 --> 01:29:41.126
Please, no more.

01:29:45.677 --> 01:29:48.785
- So, forgive me yet?
- Get off me!

01:29:52.779 --> 01:29:54.815
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

01:29:54.895 --> 01:29:56.629
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:58.711
Really?

01:30:05.874 --> 01:30:07.733
Down! Get down!

01:30:07.813 --> 01:30:09.682
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:30:09.762 --> 01:30:12.227
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

01:30:14.725 --> 01:30:16.813
- Get off!
- I got you.

01:30:16.893 --> 01:30:18.690
Ooh!

01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:21.339
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

01:30:21.732 --> 01:30:23.893
Harley! No! Get off me!

01:30:23.973 --> 01:30:26.884
- Harley!
- They got the kid. Shit!

01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:31.149
We can't let them get her.
I trust you.

01:30:31.813 --> 01:30:34.003
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

01:30:34.036 --> 01:30:37.197
- Has anyone got any bullets?
- Fuck! I'm out.

01:30:37.786 --> 01:30:40.261
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

01:30:40.789 --> 01:30:44.681
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Guys, they're in the car.

01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:48.195
- They're getting away.
- Get in there! -Get off!

01:30:49.933 --> 01:30:51.907
Shit! I'm out.

01:30:51.987 --> 01:30:54.233
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

01:30:54.999 --> 01:30:58.340
Canary, you know
what you have to do!

01:30:58.858 --> 01:31:02.177
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:24.291
Told ya she had
a killer voice.

01:31:45.013 --> 01:31:47.015
Need a ride?

01:32:12.037 --> 01:32:14.039
Get her!

01:32:44.097 --> 01:32:46.437
Oh!

01:32:56.974 --> 01:32:58.978
- Whip me!
- What?

01:32:59.058 --> 01:33:01.060
- Whip me!
- Okay.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.022
- Kid!
- Harley!

01:33:12.102 --> 01:33:14.104
Shoot her!

01:33:22.006 --> 01:33:25.357
- Harley!
- Hit the brakes!

01:33:44.922 --> 01:33:46.924
No!

01:33:59.102 --> 01:34:01.104
Uh-oh.

01:34:27.158 --> 01:34:29.160
Kid!

01:34:40.994 --> 01:34:42.995
Harley!

01:35:00.073 --> 01:35:03.005
Well, we always did share
a love of the dramatic.

01:35:03.085 --> 01:35:05.087
Didn't we?

01:35:06.193 --> 01:35:08.490
And look at us now.

01:35:09.258 --> 01:35:12.076
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

01:35:12.157 --> 01:35:14.632
I'm the only one
who can protect you!

01:35:17.234 --> 01:35:20.011
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:22.092
You're not the type!

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:25.590
But me? You need me!

01:35:40.161 --> 01:35:43.533
Here's the thing, Romy baby.

01:35:45.165 --> 01:35:49.183
Your protection is based on the fact
that people are scared of you.

01:35:49.263 --> 01:35:51.634
Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.

01:35:57.134 --> 01:35:59.641
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

01:36:00.084 --> 01:36:02.163
Not you, and not Mr. J.

01:36:02.243 --> 01:36:05.625
'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

01:36:13.169 --> 01:36:15.171
Shit.

01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:19.178
- That was super embarrassing.
- Hmm. Sure was.

01:36:19.259 --> 01:36:23.537
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

01:36:24.304 --> 01:36:26.602
I'm sorry, kid.

01:36:27.141 --> 01:36:30.616
And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.

01:36:32.155 --> 01:36:34.157
For what it's worth,

01:36:35.127 --> 01:36:38.603
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

01:36:39.244 --> 01:36:40.207
Ew.

01:36:40.287 --> 01:36:44.086
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:48.079
- Excuse me!
- I stole something from you.

01:36:48.159 --> 01:36:51.248
- You slippery-fingered little turd.
- I took your ring.

01:36:51.328 --> 01:36:53.522
My ring?

01:36:55.332 --> 01:36:57.334
Dope.

01:37:17.143 --> 01:37:19.971
- Cass! Harley!
- We're okay.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.161
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:37:26.266 --> 01:37:28.578
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:37:28.587 --> 01:37:32.588
- Good. Fuck that guy.
- Yeah. Tacos?

01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:36.288
No, but seriously.
You were very impressive with that bow.

01:37:36.369 --> 01:37:39.124
- Very impressive.
- It's a crossbow.

01:37:39.204 --> 01:37:41.292
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Morning margaritas!

01:37:41.372 --> 01:37:43.096
Thank you. I got you.

01:37:43.176 --> 01:37:46.150
- You drink, right, kid?
- I don't think so.

01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:48.283
And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.

01:37:48.308 --> 01:37:49.334
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:52.261
- Oh, great name.
- Wow.

01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:55.158
Um... I really like
how you were able

01:37:55.238 --> 01:37:57.713
to kick so high
in those tight pants.

01:37:57.776 --> 01:38:00.288
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Thanks.

01:38:00.368 --> 01:38:03.594
Thanks for the car.

01:38:04.341 --> 01:38:06.210
You're welcome.

01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:10.642
Kid, if that burrito doesn't
make you shit, I don't know what will.

01:38:12.234 --> 01:38:14.235
Give me a minute.

01:38:14.423 --> 01:38:16.167
Yes!

01:38:16.247 --> 01:38:18.597
Right.

01:38:19.985 --> 01:38:22.150
I've given her prune juice,
laxatives.

01:38:22.156 --> 01:38:24.241
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

01:38:24.292 --> 01:38:26.363
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

01:38:26.443 --> 01:38:28.324
Me?

01:38:29.102 --> 01:38:31.848
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

01:38:33.677 --> 01:38:35.679
I'm used to it.

01:38:35.762 --> 01:38:39.082
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

01:38:40.703 --> 01:38:44.054
- Ladies.
- Have fun with that.

01:38:44.749 --> 01:38:47.162
So, what now?

01:38:47.699 --> 01:38:50.726
Sionis is gone, but it's just a matter
of time before some other asshole

01:38:50.806 --> 01:38:53.604
- tries to finish what he started.
- Right.

01:38:53.684 --> 01:38:57.025
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

01:38:57.646 --> 01:39:00.725
Does she always talk like the cop in
a bad '80s movie, or is that just me?

01:39:00.805 --> 01:39:03.655
- Fuck you. And fuck you.
- What?

01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:07.585
- I mean, we were amazing there.
- Yeah! Hell yeah!

01:39:07.665 --> 01:39:10.630
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:12.705
- Thank you.
- Right.

01:39:12.785 --> 01:39:14.787
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

01:39:16.746 --> 01:39:19.811
- She stole my fucking car!
- What?

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:25.649
- I'm sorry.
- I know what you're thinking.

01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:28.604
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

01:39:28.684 --> 01:39:31.763
But you heard what the cop
said. Sionis is gone.

01:39:31.843 --> 01:39:37.196
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

01:39:37.796 --> 01:39:41.585
Montoya's boss picked up
the gangbangers at the Booby Trap.

01:39:41.665 --> 01:39:44.608
And took all the credit
while he was at it.

01:39:44.688 --> 01:39:46.690
Again.

01:39:51.674 --> 01:39:54.742
It was the kick in the balls she needed
to see that she had nothing to prove

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:57.119
to those blowhard assholes.

01:39:57.710 --> 01:40:00.112
She quit the same day.

01:40:04.726 --> 01:40:06.711
We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.

01:40:06.791 --> 01:40:09.266
And Huntress
got her family money back.

01:40:10.712 --> 01:40:13.797
She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.

01:40:16.685 --> 01:40:20.099
They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.

01:40:20.741 --> 01:40:23.320
I call them
dorky little do-gooders.

01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:29.836
The rock itself was worth a
chunk of change, so I pawned it.

01:40:29.916 --> 01:40:32.630
And I invested the cash
in a little startup

01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:34.712
making waves in the East End.

01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:39.793
Oh! And I found Bruce.

01:40:39.873 --> 01:40:42.659
He was wandering
around Chinatown.

01:40:42.739 --> 01:40:46.257
I guess it proves the theory that
hyenas really do have nine lives.

01:41:06.814 --> 01:41:10.175
