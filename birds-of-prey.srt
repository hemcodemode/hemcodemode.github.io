<font color="#ffff00">They say, if you wanna
tell a story right,</font>

2
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,106
<font color="#ffff00">you gotta start
at the beginning.</font>

3
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,214
<font color="#ffff00">Too far? Fine.</font>

4
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,737
<font color="#ffff00">This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</font>

5
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:46,761
<font color="#ffff00">When I was a kid, my dad
traded me for a six-pack of beer.</font>

6
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:48,617
<font color="#ffff00">But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</font>

7
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:51,308
<font color="#ffff00">- Daddy!
- ...I kept coming back.</font>

8
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,705
<font color="#ffff00">Eventually,
he found me a new home.</font>

9
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:57,262
<font color="#ffff00">The good sisters of St.
Bernadette's taught me a lot.</font>

10
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:02,141
<font color="#ffff00">But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</font>

11
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,789
<font color="#ffff00">All things considered, I did good.
I even went to college.</font>

12
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,730
<font color="#ffff00">Got my PhD.
Had my heart broken once or twice.</font>

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,784
<font color="#ffff00">Finding love, it's not easy.</font>

14
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,704
<font color="#ffff00">So I threw myself into my work,
became a psychiatrist.</font>

15
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,564
<font color="#ffff00">That's when I met him.
Mr. J. My Joker.</font>

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,764
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I fell hard. Like out
of a plane without a parachute,</font>

17
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,860
<font color="#ffff00">right in your dumb
fucking face kinda hard.</font>

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,779
<font color="#ffff00">I lost all sense of who I was.</font>

19
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,845
<font color="#ffff00">I only had eyes for Puddin'.
We all know the saying,</font>

20
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:37,724
<font color="#ffff00">"Behind every successful man
"there's a badass broad."</font>

21
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,873
<font color="#ffff00">Well, that was me.
I was the brains behind some of</font>

22
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,516
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. J's greatest stunts.
Not that he let anyone know it.</font>

23
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,310
<font color="#ffff00">Puddin'?</font>

24
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:49,193
<font color="#ffff00">I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</font>

25
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:50,969
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

26
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,851
<font color="#ffff00">...we broke up.</font>

27
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,743
<font color="#ffff00">I handled it real mature.</font>

28
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:03,227
<font color="#ffff00">But Mr. J was
super broke up about it.</font>

29
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:11,244
<font color="#ffff00">I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</font>

30
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,883
<font color="#ffff00">It gave me the space
to really reflect</font>

31
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:18,271
<font color="#ffff00">on the mistakes of my past.</font>

32
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:25,235
<font color="#ffff00">I had to find a new identity.</font>

33
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,615
<font color="#ffff00">A new me.</font>

34
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:34,889
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't easy. But after a while,
I even opened myself up</font>

35
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,247
<font color="#ffff00">to the possibility
of new love.</font>

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,724
<font color="#ffff00">Hi. Hello, nice baby.</font>

37
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,354
<font color="#ffff00">- Here's the thing about new love...
- I take payment-in-kind.</font>

38
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,200
<font color="#ffff00">...you have to feed it.</font>

39
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,898
<font color="#ffff00">Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.</font>

40
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,849
<font color="#ffff00">Ready to move on,
to make new friends.</font>

41
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,821
<font color="#ffff00">She means fucking business!</font>

42
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:15,968
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, here we go!
- Whip me!</font>

43
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,856
<font color="#ffff00">She has taken a whip from the
pivot, catapulted to the high side!</font>

44
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,027
<font color="#ffff00">Oh!</font>

45
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,472
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah! Come on!</font>

46
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,465
<font color="#ffff00">It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</font>

47
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,997
<font color="#ffff00">so I really
put myself out there.</font>

48
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:41,397
<font color="#ffff00">Ride that pole
like you ride your man!</font>

49
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,924
<font color="#ffff00">God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.</font>

50
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,216
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- I said...</font>

51
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,950
<font color="#ffff00">Sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.</font>

52
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,031
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

53
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:01,822
<font color="#ffff00">You broke my fucking legs!</font>

54
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,904
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, boo-hoo.</font>

55
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,941
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

56
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:12,324
<font color="#ffff00">It's not a party without
a little drama, am I right?</font>

57
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,873
<font color="#ffff00">Come on! Turn it up!</font>

58
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,011
<font color="#ffff00">Shots on the house.</font>

59
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,035
<font color="#ffff00">Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.</font>

60
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,445
<font color="#ffff00">- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.</font>

61
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,998
<font color="#ffff00">- That was my driver.
- Oh, whoops.</font>

62
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,021
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.</font>

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,917
<font color="#ffff00">Consider me grateful. Especially
since I know you don't like me.</font>

64
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,912
<font color="#ffff00">I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.</font>

65
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:37,967
<font color="#ffff00">That and his obsessive-compulsive
need to be the center of attention.</font>

66
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,449
<font color="#ffff00">Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?</font>

67
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:44,443
<font color="#ffff00">Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.</font>

68
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,007
<font color="#ffff00">Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.</font>

69
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,969
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, fine, so I hadn't
told people about the breakup.</font>

70
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,044
<font color="#ffff00">- But you don't understand.
- Find me a new driver.</font>

71
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:57,527
<font color="#ffff00">Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</font>

72
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,905
<font color="#ffff00">I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</font>

73
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,325
<font color="#ffff00">and no one
ever dared to object.</font>

74
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:22,393
<font color="#ffff00">And don't let him give you shit, okay?
You have to stick up for yourself.</font>

75
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,881
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, please. I give it a few days
before they're back together.</font>

76
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,874
<font color="#ffff00"> Even when I did try and tell
people, they didn't believe me.</font>

77
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,876
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. She told me they're
really broken up this time.</font>

78
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:54,515
<font color="#ffff00">Sure they are, Shell. That's why she's
still wearing that tacky "J" necklace.</font>

79
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,946
<font color="#ffff00">She is going to be running right back into
his arms the minute he snaps his fingers.</font>

80
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,033
<font color="#ffff00">If not him, the next closest
alpha male with a pulse.</font>

81
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,105
<font color="#ffff00">Some people just aren't
born to stand on their own.</font>

82
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:08,038
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, girl, let's drink. Come on.
- All right.</font>

83
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,967
<font color="#ffff00">I knew I needed to find
some way to show the world</font>

84
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:14,043
<font color="#ffff00">that I'd cut ties with Mr. J
for good.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.</font>

87
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,046
<font color="#ffff00">The Joker and I?
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic</font>

<font color="#ffff00">industrial processing plant.</font>

89
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:36,536
<font color="#ffff00">And luckily for me,
I have all my best ideas drunk.</font>

90
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,768
<font color="#ffff00">I have the best idea!</font>

91
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:51,588
<font color="#ffff00">The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!</font>

where it all began, Puddin'.</font>

00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,581
<font color="#ffff00">You motherfucker!</font>

94
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,680
<font color="#ffff00">It was the closure I needed.</font>

95
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:40,589
<font color="#ffff00">A fresh start.
A chance to be my own woman.</font>

96
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,163
<font color="#ffff00">But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.</font>

97
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,473
<font color="#ffff00">This is our story.</font>

98
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,499
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm telling it,
so I'll start where I fucking want.</font>

99
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:11,148
<font color="#ffff00">- Meet the cop.
- I got 50 says it was turf war.</font>

100

- Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.</font>

a career-making case.</font>

- Go ahead.</font>

109

took all the credit.</font>

110

at detective level with this idiot.</font>

- Yo, mind your debt.</font>

117
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,771

That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Wow.</font>

132
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:18,627
<font color="#ffff00">Detective.
Found this necklace.</font>

133
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:22,334
<font color="#ffff00">Holy shit.</font>

134
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,233
<font color="#ffff00">Good work, Officer.</font>

135
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,339
<font color="#ffff00">What is it?</font>

136
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:32,190
<font color="#ffff00">- Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.
- What?</font>

137
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,371
<font color="#ffff00">This was their spot. She just publicly
updated her relationship status.</font>

138
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:41,209
<font color="#ffff00">Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.</font>

139
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,148
<font color="#ffff00">She did not
think this one through.</font>

140
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,379
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</font>

141
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,372
<font color="#ffff00">I'm about to learn that a lot of
people in this city want me dead.</font>

142
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:53,658
<font color="#ffff00">And at the top of that list
is this guy.</font>

143
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:57,818
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.</font>

144
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:02,854
<font color="#ffff00">You kinda forced my hand here.
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.</font>

145
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,673
<font color="#ffff00">I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?</font>

146
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,402
<font color="#ffff00">And I thought... Shh!</font>

147
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,262
<font color="#ffff00">I thought we could build
something beautiful together.</font>

148
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,660
<font color="#ffff00">I thought we could be family.</font>

149
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,872
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna set you free.</font>

150
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,308
<font color="#ffff00">Mmm...</font>

151
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:43,879
<font color="#ffff00">What about her?</font>

152
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,653
<font color="#ffff00">I think we can let her go.</font>

153
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:53,773
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.</font>

154
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,405
<font color="#ffff00">Baby. Aww.</font>

155
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,699
<font color="#ffff00">Don't cry.</font>

156
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,922
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.
Thank you.</font>

157
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,316
<font color="#ffff00">You're welcome.</font>

158
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,310
<font color="#ffff00">Is that a snot bubble?</font>

159
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,427
<font color="#ffff00">- Ew. Gross.
- What?</font>

160
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,899
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.</font>

161
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,408
<font color="#ffff00">No. No!</font>

162
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:26,406
<font color="#ffff00">The wack job with the penchant
for peeling faces is Roman Sionis,</font>

163
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,878
<font color="#ffff00">aka Black Mask.</font>

164
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,300
<font color="#ffff00">The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.</font>

165
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,959
<font color="#ffff00">See, I was halfway across town,</font>

166
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:42,922
<font color="#ffff00">hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.</font>

167
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,906
<font color="#ffff00">Egg, bacon, American cheese.</font>

168
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,306
<font color="#ffff00">Soft, toasted buttered roll.</font>

169
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,464
<font color="#ffff00">Just a dash of hot sauce.</font>

170
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:00,426
<font color="#ffff00">Not too much, Sal.
I wanna taste the cheese.</font>

171
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,868
<font color="#ffff00">What a way to
start my new life.</font>

172
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,986
<font color="#ffff00">With the perfect egg sandwich.</font>

173
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,495
<font color="#ffff00">Mmm!</font>

174
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,939
<font color="#ffff00">You're a lifesaver, Sal.</font>

175
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,861
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm good for the 75 cents,
okay? I promise.</font>

176
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:24,865
<font color="#ffff00">That's all the money I got
in the world, and it's so worth it.</font>

177
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,525
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</font>

178
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:34,415
<font color="#ffff00">or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,</font>

179
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:38,355
<font color="#ffff00">but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.</font>

180
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,828
<font color="#ffff00">I mean it, Sal. No one.</font>

181
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,950
<font color="#ffff00">Freeze! Gotham PD.</font>

182
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:00,736
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I don't think so.</font>

183
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,396
<font color="#ffff00">Are you fucking kidding me?</font>

184
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,466
<font color="#ffff00">Yo! Police.</font>

185
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:12,449
<font color="#ffff00">It had been six short hours
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals</font>

186
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,515
<font color="#ffff00">announced to the world
that Mr. J and I were dunzo.</font>

187
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,937
<font color="#ffff00">The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</font>

188
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:24,397
<font color="#ffff00">Cops who never would've dared
come after me before</font>

189
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,848
<font color="#ffff00">were suddenly doing this.</font>

190
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,417
<font color="#ffff00">- Ooh!
- Freeze!</font>

191
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:39,067
<font color="#ffff00">And what's worse? Every person
I ever wronged now felt free</font>

192
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,440
<font color="#ffff00">to come and
take their pound of flesh.</font>

193
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,013
<font color="#ffff00">Turns out
I wronged a lot of people.</font>

194
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,935
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, boy. Get him!</font>

195
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,672
<font color="#ffff00">Oh...</font>

196
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:24,646
<font color="#ffff00">Finally.</font>

197
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,637
<font color="#ffff00">- And then...
- We're gonna get through this, okay?</font>

198
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,963
<font color="#ffff00">...tragedy struck.</font>

199
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,232
<font color="#ffff00">It took losing
something I truly love</font>

200
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:55,435
<font color="#ffff00">for me to see that
the target on my back</font>

201
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:57,529
<font color="#ffff00">was bigger than I thought.</font>

202
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,576
<font color="#ffff00">Freeze!</font>

203
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:02,200
<font color="#ffff00">With the walls
closing in around me,</font>

204
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:06,927
<font color="#ffff00">I made a carefully calculated,
highly strategic move.</font>

205
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,489
<font color="#ffff00">Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...</font>

206
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,571
<font color="#ffff00">That felt pretty great.</font>

207
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,454
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.</font>

208
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,676
<font color="#ffff00">- See ya. Oh!
- There she is.</font>

209
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,825
<font color="#ffff00">- Harley Quinn.
- Yeah?</font>

210
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:37,568
<font color="#ffff00">- I've waited a long time for this.
- You have?</font>

211
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,124
<font color="#ffff00">Oh... I haven't had breakfast yet.</font>

212
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:46,003
<font color="#ffff00">- What did I do to you?
- Are you serious?</font>

213
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,690
<font color="#ffff00">Look at my face.</font>

214
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,988
<font color="#ffff00">Look at my face!</font>

215
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,647
<font color="#ffff00">Oh...</font>

216
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:03,223
<font color="#ffff00">- That wasn't me.
- But you dared him to do it.</font>

217
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,887
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?</font>

218
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,669
<font color="#ffff00">- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.</font>

219
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:13,576
<font color="#ffff00">That means there's
no one here to stop me.</font>

220
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,610
<font color="#ffff00">- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.</font>

221
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,792
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh. A penny.</font>

222
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,008
<font color="#ffff00">They're shooting arrows now?</font>

223
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,282
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, crap. Him, too?</font>

224
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,724
<font color="#ffff00">Parley?</font>

225
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,650
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck, Montoya, you smell
like a dead rat's asshole.</font>

226
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,189
<font color="#ffff00">- Not today, Simpson.
- Hey, it's Detective Montoya.</font>

227
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,623
<font color="#ffff00">Respect your elders.
I mean, your elderly.</font>

228
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,771
<font color="#ffff00">You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.</font>

229
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,626
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna go there?</font>

230
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,660
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.</font>

231
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,766
<font color="#ffff00">Cassandra Cain,
back already?</font>

232
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:14,249
<font color="#ffff00">Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.</font>

233
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,727
<font color="#ffff00">What? No comeback?</font>

234
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,690
<font color="#ffff00">You all right?</font>

235
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:25,134
<font color="#ffff00">You smell like shit.</font>

236
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,675
<font color="#ffff00">Yo, Simpson.</font>

237
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:32,191
<font color="#ffff00">Any clean clothes
in lost and found?</font>

238
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:38,176
<font color="#ffff00">These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.</font>

239
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,699
<font color="#ffff00">The Sionis family name is on half
the museums and schools in Gotham.</font>

240
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:44,275
<font color="#ffff00">And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?</font>

241
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,756
<font color="#ffff00">Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.</font>

242
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,280
<font color="#ffff00">Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</font>

243
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:53,679
<font color="#ffff00">That's him. He had four people
killed alone last night.</font>

244
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,703
<font color="#ffff00">If Sionis is such a mastermind, how'd he
get fired from his own fucking company?</font>

245
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:00,716
<font color="#ffff00">The Janus Corporation
is his father's company, thank you.</font>

246
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,812
<font color="#ffff00">And by the way,
they cut him off.</font>

247
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,710
<font color="#ffff00">Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?</font>

248
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,765
<font color="#ffff00">To make matters worse, the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</font>

249
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,309
<font color="#ffff00">The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...</font>

250
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:13,729
<font color="#ffff00">There's a shipment coming in.</font>

251
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:15,771
<font color="#ffff00">- Drugs?
- A diamond.</font>

252
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,004
<font color="#ffff00">Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?</font>

253
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,307
<font color="#ffff00">Listen,
I had a source at the club.</font>

254
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,674
<font color="#ffff00">His driver. He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.</font>

255
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:25,780
<font color="#ffff00">And he said that he overheard
something about laser-encoding.</font>

256
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,836
<font color="#ffff00">Now, I did some research.
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.</font>

257
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,776
<font color="#ffff00">You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?</font>

258
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:36,633
<font color="#ffff00">Quick history lesson. Fifteen years
ago, one of the wealthiest</font>

259
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,823
<font color="#ffff00">Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</font>

260
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:41,732
<font color="#ffff00">It was a power grab,
but the real target</font>

261
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:46,019
<font color="#ffff00">was the Bertinellis' super-secret
offshore bank accounts,</font>

262
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:49,163
<font color="#ffff00">the details of which were said

00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:53,669
<font color="#ffff00">of a 30-carat diamond.
The rock was lost.</font>

264
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,745
<font color="#ffff00">And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</font>

265
00:19:56,825 --> 00:20:01,344
<font color="#ffff00">Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.</font>

266
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:04,856
<font color="#ffff00">That's what makes him so dangerous.
He's already building an army.</font>

267
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,839
<font color="#ffff00">If he gets the diamond, he'll
have all the money and connections</font>

268
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,697
<font color="#ffff00">to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.</font>

- Yes. He's...</font>

270
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,684
<font color="#ffff00">- He's no longer there, but...
- So basically, you have nothing.</font>

271
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,759
<font color="#ffff00">You are trying to go after</font>

272
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,720
<font color="#ffff00">one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,</font>

273
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,753
<font color="#ffff00">and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?</font>

274
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,756
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you know, the DA's office
is building a case against him, too.</font>

275
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:35,874
<font color="#ffff00">- Isn't that right, Miss Yee?
- If the DA is willing to throw himself</font>

276
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,857
<font color="#ffff00">- out in front of this, it's fine with me.
- Captain, no.</font>

277
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:44,393
<font color="#ffff00">Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?</font>

278
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,738
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.</font>

279
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,834
<font color="#ffff00">This is my case, okay? I've been
working on this for six months.</font>

280
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,235
<font color="#ffff00">We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.</font>

281
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,817
<font color="#ffff00">And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.</font>

282
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,732
<font color="#ffff00">Look, I'm sorry about
that, but I...</font>

283
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:05,797
<font color="#ffff00">That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?</font>

284
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,368
<font color="#ffff00">- Me? He gave my case away.
- Oh, poor Renee.</font>

285
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:10,739
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't you pour yourself
a drink? It's almost noon.</font>

286
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,821
<font color="#ffff00">Wow.</font>

287
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,745
<font color="#ffff00">Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?</font>

288
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,758
<font color="#ffff00">Why the fuck haven't you been picking
up your phone? We've got a situation.</font>

289
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:23,740
<font color="#ffff00">- What... What situation?
- You didn't hear this from me,</font>

290
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,805
<font color="#ffff00">but you gotta find her
before someone else does.</font>

291
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,900
<font color="#ffff00">She's got the diamond, and
trust me, Roman will kill her.</font>

292
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,850
<font color="#ffff00">- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
- This kid.</font>

293
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,885
<font color="#ffff00">She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.</font>

294
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,346
<font color="#ffff00">Holy fuck.</font>

295
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,970
<font color="#ffff00">- Can I help you?
- Why, yes. Yes, you can.</font>

296
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,224
<font color="#ffff00">I'm here to
report a terrible crime.</font>

297
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:55,446
<font color="#ffff00">And what terrible crime is that?</font>

298
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:59,904
<font color="#ffff00">This one.</font>

299
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,269
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, boys.</font>

300
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,927
<font color="#ffff00">Meeting's over.</font>

301
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:25,319
<font color="#ffff00">Run, piggy, run.</font>

302
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,020
<font color="#ffff00">Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?</font>

303
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:40,893
<font color="#ffff00"> Hold up, hold up. I'm telling
this all wrong. Let's rewind.</font>

304
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:43,969
<font color="#ffff00">For you to understand why me,
the cop, and that dame on the toilet...</font>

305
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,043
<font color="#ffff00">Her name's Cassandra Cain.</font>

306
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,984
<font color="#ffff00">...are all looking for
this Cain character.</font>

307
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,487
<font color="#ffff00">I gotta take you back
a few days,</font>

308
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:54,449
<font color="#ffff00">to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.</font>

309
00:23:56,988 --> 00:24:02,373
<font color="#ffff00">This is a man's world</font>

310
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,545
<font color="#ffff00">This is a man's world...</font>

311
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:13,549
<font color="#ffff00">- This is Dinah Lance.
- But it would be nothing</font>

312
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,553
<font color="#ffff00">- But she prefers Black Canary.
- Nothing...</font>

313
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,931
<font color="#ffff00">- She's got a killer voice.
- Without a woman or a girl...</font>

314
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,069
<font color="#ffff00">But there was some other shit
going down that night.</font>

315
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:26,956
<font color="#ffff00">...short notice like this.</font>

316

superficial partnerships.</font>

317
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:33,557
<font color="#ffff00">I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.</font>

318
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:37,101
<font color="#ffff00">The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.</font>

319
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:41,574
<font color="#ffff00">I can.
Loans, liquidity, laundering.</font>

320
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:44,931
<font color="#ffff00">Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,</font>

321
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:48,027
<font color="#ffff00">there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.</font>

323
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,980
<font color="#ffff00">I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.</font>

324
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,056
<font color="#ffff00">But with all due respect,</font>

325
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,528
<font color="#ffff00">the Golden Lions
are a family business.</font>

326
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:03,040
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck family. All due respect,
but fuck that.</font>

327
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,013
<font color="#ffff00">Family's a fucking illusion. You know
what my family gave me? Nothing.</font>

328
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:10,119
<font color="#ffff00">I know what everyone says.
"Here comes Roman Sionis.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.</font>

332
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:21,631
<font color="#ffff00">But look at me now.</font>

333
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:26,082
<font color="#ffff00">I've located the Bertinelli diamond.
I'm about to own this city.</font>

334
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:30,054
<font color="#ffff00">Not just the East End.
I am thinking big, baby.</font>

335
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:35,080
<font color="#ffff00">And I want you there with me.
We could make our own family.</font>

336
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,988
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Sionis,
the Golden Lions have operated</font>

337
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,070
<font color="#ffff00">in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.</font>

338
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,628
<font color="#ffff00">We have no need
of your protection.</font>

339
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,579
<font color="#ffff00">He's gonna regret that.</font>

340
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,181
<font color="#ffff00">Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?</font>

341
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,110
<font color="#ffff00">Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,</font>

342
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,999
<font color="#ffff00">and I'll come see you at
the docks, day after tomorrow.</font>

343
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,081
<font color="#ffff00">Okay?</font>

344
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:14,187
<font color="#ffff00">This is a man's world</font>

You are.</font>

00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,351
<font color="#ffff00">Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.</font>

394
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,290
<font color="#ffff00">Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.</font>

395
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,293
<font color="#ffff00">- Are we getting breakfast?
- Hey, buddy, I'm gonna need some help.</font>

396
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,233
<font color="#ffff00">This is my friend.
I told you all about...</font>

397
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,821
<font color="#ffff00">- Hey, get the door, man. There we go.
- Wait.</font>

398
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:20,209
<font color="#ffff00">- Isn't that Joker's girl?
- Not anymore.</font>

399
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,304
<font color="#ffff00">- Got room for one more?
- Hey.</font>

400
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,386
<font color="#ffff00">Huh?</font>

401
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,823
<font color="#ffff00">I don't need your help.
I got this.</font>

402
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,784
<font color="#ffff00">You got this?
You sure about that?</font>

403
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,313
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.</font>

404
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,708
<font color="#ffff00">Uh...</font>

405
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,370
<font color="#ffff00">You got this!</font>

406
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,773
<font color="#ffff00">You motherfucker!</font>

407
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,387
<font color="#ffff00">Whoo!</font>

408
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:05,907
<font color="#ffff00">Well, well, well,
well, well, well.</font>

409
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,430
<font color="#ffff00">Could that be
our little Miss Lance?</font>

410
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,257
<font color="#ffff00">All these years,
I thought she was just a pretty face</font>

411
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,728
<font color="#ffff00">and a fine set of lungs.</font>

412
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,353
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh.</font>

413
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:21,900
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.</font>

414
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,867
<font color="#ffff00">That's my little bird.</font>

415
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:37,945
<font color="#ffff00">Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.</font>

416
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,391
<font color="#ffff00">Shut up.</font>

417
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,889
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, songbird.</font>

418
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:46,828
<font color="#ffff00">You drive
as good as you fight?</font>

419
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,353
<font color="#ffff00">- Who's asking?
- The boss.</font>

420
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,435
<font color="#ffff00">You're getting promoted.</font>

421
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,379
<font color="#ffff00">- You're his new driver.
- Huh. Thanks,</font>

422
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,393
<font color="#ffff00">but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.</font>

423
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,834
<font color="#ffff00">You'll be good
at the driving gig.</font>

424
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:09,515
<font color="#ffff00">Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.</font>

425
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,413
<font color="#ffff00">So, that's how Canary
got herself a job</font>

426
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,978
<font color="#ffff00">driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.</font>

427
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,502
<font color="#ffff00">A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant</font>

428
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:21,871
<font color="#ffff00">without the help of yours truly.</font>

429

<font color="#ffff00">Morning.</font>

430
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,911

- I never wanted her!</font>

431
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:48,915
<font color="#ffff00">Let me guess. Parents?</font>

432
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:52,479
<font color="#ffff00">- Foster parents.
- Right.</font>

433
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,512
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, kid.</font>

434
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:57,025
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry about your face.</font>

435
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,361
<font color="#ffff00">Shit, you do have something
on your face.</font>

436
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:03,906
<font color="#ffff00">You should've seen
the other guy.</font>

437
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,513
<font color="#ffff00">Uh...</font>

438
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:10,370
<font color="#ffff00">I want that kid out
of my fucking house!</font>

439
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,935
<font color="#ffff00">You know, kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.</font>

440
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:15,938
<font color="#ffff00">You just gotta hang in there.</font>

441
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,862
<font color="#ffff00">Get something to eat.</font>

442
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,939
<font color="#ffff00">Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.</font>

443
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:38,548
<font color="#ffff00">Don't talk to me like that.</font>

444
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,409
<font color="#ffff00">Canary spends the next week</font>

- Who the hell are you?</font>

451
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,967
<font color="#ffff00">I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.</font>

452
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:18,025
<font color="#ffff00">Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.</font>

453
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,557
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, really?</font>

454
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:23,999
<font color="#ffff00">He told me that there was a
shipment coming in. A diamond.</font>

455
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:26,487
<font color="#ffff00">A very special diamond.</font>

456
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,974
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.</font>

457
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:34,598
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know
who you're working for?</font>

458
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:38,543
<font color="#ffff00">Damn right, I do. He's the man who
gave me a job. Took me off the streets.</font>

459
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,503
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.</font>

460
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:44,464
<font color="#ffff00">A criminal. A murderer.</font>

461
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:47,568
<font color="#ffff00">What would your mother think of you
working for a guy like that, huh?</font>

462
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:51,659
<font color="#ffff00">You have the same power she had. Don't
you think she would want you to use it?</font>

463
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,639
<font color="#ffff00">The hell do you know
about my mother?</font>

464
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,673
<font color="#ffff00">Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.</font>

465
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,134
<font color="#ffff00">- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.</font>

466
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,657
<font color="#ffff00">She was a damn good woman.</font>

467
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:05,922
<font color="#ffff00">The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.</font>

468
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,632
<font color="#ffff00">And when she was found
dead in the street,</font>

469
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:12,136
<font color="#ffff00">where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?</font>

470
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:16,670
<font color="#ffff00">Now you wanna come and knock on
my door and ask me to help you out</font>

471
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,132
<font color="#ffff00">and make
the same mistake she did?</font>

472
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:24,032
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Good luck with that.</font>

473
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:29,130
<font color="#ffff00">That's fair enough.
And I'm sorry for your loss.</font>

474
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,587
<font color="#ffff00">For the record,</font>

475
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:36,188
<font color="#ffff00">that would never happen
on my watch.</font>

Of course they did.</font>

478
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,980
<font color="#ffff00">I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.</font>

479
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,577
<font color="#ffff00">It sure did, boss.
It sure fucking did.</font>

480

<font color="#ffff00">Crossbow Killer</font>

481
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,698
<font color="#ffff00">struck again last night.
Rossi and four of his guys.</font>

482
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:01,700
<font color="#ffff00">People don't kill people I own
without my permission.</font>

483
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,702
<font color="#ffff00">Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?</font>

484
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:05,611
<font color="#ffff00">- You know that!
- I know it.</font>

485
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:08,644
<font color="#ffff00">Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?</font>

486
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:11,168
<font color="#ffff00">- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.</font>

487
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:13,711
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, good morning.
Good morning.</font>

488
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,672
<font color="#ffff00">- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.</font>

489
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:18,580
<font color="#ffff00">We're just finishing up a
little business. Look around.</font>

490
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,613
<font color="#ffff00">- You're late.
- It's fine.</font>

491
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:22,605
<font color="#ffff00">Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?</font>

492
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,045
<font color="#ffff00">No. Isn't this stunning?</font>

493
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,236
<font color="#ffff00">That is a Chokwe mask.</font>

494
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,645
<font color="#ffff00">I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe</font>

<font color="#ffff00">in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?</font>

496
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:37,524
<font color="#ffff00">I've never been.
I've heard it's beautiful.</font>

497
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:42,737
<font color="#ffff00">It's dirty. Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.</font>

498
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:46,553
<font color="#ffff00">Shuar of Ecuador. They're
amazing people. Surprisingly gentle.</font>

499
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,576
<font color="#ffff00">- I think you might like them.
- Really?</font>

500
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:52,621
<font color="#ffff00">They boil the heads of their enemies
and they make these little fellas.</font>

501
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,592
<font color="#ffff00">- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

502
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,667
<font color="#ffff00">Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.</font>

503
00:36:57,747 --> 00:36:59,658
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.</font>

504
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,608
<font color="#ffff00">And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.</font>

505
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:03,662
<font color="#ffff00">- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?</font>

506
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:05,611
<font color="#ffff00">These are
ancient acupuncture models.</font>

507
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,790
<font color="#ffff00">As you can see, they have
all the acupuncture points.</font>

508
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,273
<font color="#ffff00">And we found these
buried in the mountains.</font>

509
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,609
<font color="#ffff00">Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.</font>

510
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,103
<font color="#ffff00">All right, all right, let's find
the Crossbow Killer. I get it.</font>

511
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:21,720
<font color="#ffff00">- Is he an acupuncture model, too?
- He is not an acupuncture model.</font>

512
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,796
<font color="#ffff00">This is a statue of me. It was made
by a very famous Gotham artist...</font>

513
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,195
<font color="#ffff00">Harley Quinn did it.</font>

514
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:30,270
<font color="#ffff00">Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.</font>

515
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,789
<font color="#ffff00">They split.</font>

516
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,223
<font color="#ffff00">What's wrong with you, Victor?</font>

517
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,746
<font color="#ffff00">- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.</font>

518
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,300
<font color="#ffff00">This is spectacular news!</font>

519
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,283
<font color="#ffff00">She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.</font>

520
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,733
<font color="#ffff00">Have the boys go find her. Round her up,
bring her back. I want her.</font>

521
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:49,745
<font color="#ffff00">You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.</font>

522
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:52,290
<font color="#ffff00">Something super-duper
important, okay?</font>

523
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,552
<font color="#ffff00">- I'll go with you.
- Yeah, go with Victor.</font>

524
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,814
<font color="#ffff00">- It's just a pickup.
- No, he's harmless.</font>

525
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:59,244
<font color="#ffff00">Do as you're told. Go.</font>

526
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:16,780
<font color="#ffff00">- All right. We can go.
- I'll take that.</font>

527
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,739
<font color="#ffff00">- Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.
- Go get your car.</font>

528
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,840
<font color="#ffff00">That rock. That rock's
about to become the key</font>

529
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,188
<font color="#ffff00">to whether or not I live to
enjoy my newfound independence.</font>

530
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:36,683
<font color="#ffff00">- Get off me.
- What the hell are you doing here?</font>

531
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:40,172
<font color="#ffff00">You're not the only one who makes
money off of dumb, rich, white people.</font>

532
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:43,731
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you know what? One day you're
gonna pick the wrong pocket, sis.</font>

533
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,244
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. Whatever.</font>

534
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,238
<font color="#ffff00">Dumb-ass kids.</font>

535
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:55,169
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me. Sorry.</font>

536
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,274
<font color="#ffff00">- I really like your earrings.
- Why, thank you.</font>

537
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,153
<font color="#ffff00">There's the thief.
There's the thief.</font>

538
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:17,835
<font color="#ffff00">- Get off of me!
- That little girl took my watch.</font>

539
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,233
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't do nothing.</font>

540
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:25,769
<font color="#ffff00">Where the fuck's the diamond?
I just fucking had it.</font>

541
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,851
<font color="#ffff00">Cass!</font>

542
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:30,710
<font color="#ffff00">Wait!</font>

543
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,792
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait!</font>

544
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,756
<font color="#ffff00">Halt!</font>

545
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:36,838
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck!</font>

546
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,893
<font color="#ffff00">In the storytelling business,
this dummy swallowing that diamond</font>

547
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:03,964
<font color="#ffff00">is called a complication.</font>

548
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:09,203
<font color="#ffff00">A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.</font>

549
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,807
<font color="#ffff00">Parley?</font>

550
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:18,888
<font color="#ffff00">- We lost the diamond.
- What?</font>

551
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:20,858
<font color="#ffff00">We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...</font>

552
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:23,372
<font color="#ffff00">We never even
got our hands on it.</font>

553
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:26,759
<font color="#ffff00">Ow!</font>

554
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,813
<font color="#ffff00">Help!</font>

555
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,017
<font color="#ffff00">Get out! Get out of here!
You, too! Go!</font>

556
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,383
<font color="#ffff00">With your fucking sage
stinking my place up. Fuck off!</font>

557
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:37,977
<font color="#ffff00">- Here she is.
- She's a child!</font>

558
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:40,793
<font color="#ffff00">- She's just a kid.
- She's... What?</font>

559
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,899
<font color="#ffff00">We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.</font>

560
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:45,922
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck off! Get out.
Fucking out!</font>

561
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,759
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck! These are my things.
This diamond is my things.</font>

562
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,866
<font color="#ffff00">My things! Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?</font>

563
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:54,784
<font color="#ffff00">- No.
- Why is this happening to me?</font>

564
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:56,866
<font color="#ffff00">Why?</font>

565
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:01,906
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna get your diamond back.
I promise.</font>

566
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:07,339
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?</font>

567
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:10,414
<font color="#ffff00">Blow off a little steam.</font>

568
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:13,489
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.</font>

569
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,380
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. I'll go get changed.</font>

570
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,374
<font color="#ffff00">Shit, Cass.</font>

571
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,485
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.</font>

572
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,913
<font color="#ffff00">We're working on it.</font>

573
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:49,282
<font color="#ffff00">Now, let's go have a little fun.</font>

574
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:58,049
<font color="#ffff00">Harleen Quinzel.</font>

575
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,131
<font color="#ffff00">Whoo!</font>

576
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:03,008
<font color="#ffff00">Hiya, Romy.</font>

577
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:05,983
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?</font>

578
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,975
<font color="#ffff00">When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</font>

579
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:10,467
<font color="#ffff00">there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.</font>

580
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:13,865
<font color="#ffff00">Breaking his driver's legs. There's
that time I called it an "expresso."</font>

581
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,410
<font color="#ffff00">Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.</font>

582
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:22,998
<font color="#ffff00">Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</font>

583
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,333
<font color="#ffff00">- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.</font>

584
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:29,067
<font color="#ffff00">You're gonna do that thing where you open
up a weird-ass case of torture devices</font>

585
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:33,039
<font color="#ffff00">while inexplicably detailing your
master plan and how I don't fit into it.</font>

586
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,052
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm building a better...
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!</font>

587
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:39,355
<font color="#ffff00">You're building a criminal empire because
Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp.</font>

588
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,025
<font color="#ffff00">And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality</font>

589
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:43,016
<font color="#ffff00">it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.</font>

590
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:46,895
<font color="#ffff00">I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.</font>

591
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,918
<font color="#ffff00">And you're really not as
clever as you think, because</font>

592
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,971
<font color="#ffff00">- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.</font>

593
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:54,119
<font color="#ffff00">Now you're gonna say that you
wanna kill me to set an example.</font>

594
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,492
<font color="#ffff00">- Christ, you're boring.
- I wanna kill you...</font>

595
00:42:57,573 --> 00:43:00,471
<font color="#ffff00">- Shit.
- ...because without the Joker around,</font>

596
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,990
<font color="#ffff00">I can.</font>

597
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:10,948
<font color="#ffff00">For all your noise and bluster,
you're just a silly little girl</font>

598
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:13,690
<font color="#ffff00">with no one around
to protect her.</font>

599
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,281
<font color="#ffff00">- Whoa. Wait.
- What?</font>

600
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:21,019
<font color="#ffff00">- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.</font>

601
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,919
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.
Come on. There's gotta be something,</font>

602
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,001
<font color="#ffff00">something we can figure out.
Hey!</font>

603
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:29,120
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?</font>

604
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:33,069
<font color="#ffff00">You lost something.
I heard you say it. A diamond.</font>

605
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:39,981
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

606
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:42,122
<font color="#ffff00">I can help you find it.</font>

607
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,594
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously. Look in my pocket.</font>

608
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,991
<font color="#ffff00">Other pocket.</font>

609
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,055
<font color="#ffff00">I'm starting up
my own business.</font>

610
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,137
<font color="#ffff00">See what it says?
Second from the bottom.</font>

611
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,522
<font color="#ffff00">I know the East End
better than anybody.</font>

612
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:13,066
<font color="#ffff00">You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.</font>

613
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:16,944
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,</font>

614
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:19,061
<font color="#ffff00">and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.</font>

615
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,125
<font color="#ffff00">If you let me go,</font>

616
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:25,129
<font color="#ffff00">just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.</font>

617
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,632
<font color="#ffff00">What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,</font>

618
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,575
<font color="#ffff00">swear to God,
you can kill me later.</font>

619
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,073
<font color="#ffff00">Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.</font>

620
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,155
<font color="#ffff00">You're so tiresome!</font>

621
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:40,142
<font color="#ffff00">If you want my mercy, shut that hole
in the middle of your face and listen.</font>

622
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:43,511
<font color="#ffff00">You're gonna
get me my diamond.</font>

623
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:54,040
<font color="#ffff00">A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental</font>

624
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:57,680
<font color="#ffff00">But diamonds are
a girl's best friend</font>

625
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,203
<font color="#ffff00">A kiss may be grand</font>

626
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:05,666
<font color="#ffff00">But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat</font>

627
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">Or help you at the automat</font>

628
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:13,067
<font color="#ffff00">Diamonds</font>

629
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:14,089
<font color="#ffff00"> I will be waiting.</font>

630
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,121
<font color="#ffff00">Diamonds</font>

631

<font color="#ffff00">Diamonds</font>

632

<font color="#ffff00"> The diamond.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Romy, Roman.</font>

635
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:23,557
<font color="#ffff00">I will be waiting.</font>

636
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,183
<font color="#ffff00">But diamonds</font>

637
00:45:26,263 --> 00:45:29,552
<font color="#ffff00">Diamonds are a girl's best</font>

638
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:35,579
<font color="#ffff00">I'll give you till midnight.</font>

639
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,216
<font color="#ffff00">And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face</font>

640
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:41,625
<font color="#ffff00">and pickle it.</font>

641
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,154
<font color="#ffff00">Okay?</font>

642
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,246
<font color="#ffff00">Call me old-fashioned,
but I always thought the guy</font>

643
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:51,645
<font color="#ffff00">was meant to
get the girl a diamond.</font>

644
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:59,234
<font color="#ffff00">I won't let you down, Romy.
I promise.</font>

645
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:01,257
<font color="#ffff00">Let's make it half a mil.</font>

646
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:04,071
<font color="#ffff00">It's more fun
if she's got competition.</font>

647
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,752
<font color="#ffff00">Send it to
every mercenary in Gotham.</font>

648
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:09,191
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.</font>

649
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:11,725
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.</font>

650
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:32,169
<font color="#ffff00">Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?</font>

651
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:35,131
<font color="#ffff00">We've got a situation.
This kid, she's got the diamond.</font>

652

00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:39,204
<font color="#ffff00">Holy fuck.</font>

654
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,066
<font color="#ffff00">Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?</font>

655
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:46,148
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. Now we're good.</font>

656

00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,797
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks, doll. You're a peach.</font>

658
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,318
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I know that guy.</font>

661
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,208

Access denied. Denied.</font>

662

Denied. Denied. Denied.</font>

663
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:36,644
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm. Perfect.</font>

664
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,336
<font color="#ffff00">- Hold up, hold up. Remember me?
- She stole my car!</font>

665
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,191
<font color="#ffff00">- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!</font>

666
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:58,141
<font color="#ffff00">- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.</font>

667
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:00,164
<font color="#ffff00">- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.</font>

668
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,176
<font color="#ffff00">What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!</font>

669
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:05,199
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, sorry about that.
- You're dead!</font>

670
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,254
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!
- Hey, kid.</font>

671
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:10,371
<font color="#ffff00">- You're that psycho from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

- Yeah.</font>

673
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,362
<font color="#ffff00">I need to know where...</font>

674
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,302
<font color="#ffff00">- Hold, please.
- Harley...</font>

675
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:03,427
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm.</font>

676
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:08,749
<font color="#ffff00">I got you, you little shit.</font>

677
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:11,496
<font color="#ffff00">Who are you guys?</font>

678
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:14,416
<font color="#ffff00">Go, go, go.</font>

679
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,503
<font color="#ffff00">Keep the kid alive.</font>

680
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,494
<font color="#ffff00">Mmm!</font>

681
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,582
<font color="#ffff00">A little help.</font>

682
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:29,589
<font color="#ffff00">Mmm...</font>

683
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,917
<font color="#ffff00">Does she have to keep running?</font>

684
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:13,132
<font color="#ffff00">Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.</font>

685
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,573

687
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:24,423

- The phone?</font>

688
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:26,505
<font color="#ffff00">Sure.</font>

689
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,601
<font color="#ffff00">Mmm.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Oh, good. You're awake.
Toss that for me, will ya?</font>

692
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,536
<font color="#ffff00">What the fuck?</font>

693
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:23,517
<font color="#ffff00">Who did I just blow up?</font>

694
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,540
<font color="#ffff00">Either someone
who wants me dead,</font>

695
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,991
<font color="#ffff00">or someone looking to collect the
half-million dollar reward on your head.</font>

696
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,503
<font color="#ffff00">- Half a million dollars?
- Yeah.</font>

697
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,090
<font color="#ffff00">Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?</font>

698
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:37,497
<font color="#ffff00">- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.</font>

699
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:40,719
<font color="#ffff00">- Now, uncuff me.
- Oh, sure.</font>

700
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,636
<font color="#ffff00">- As soon as you give me the diamond.
- What diamond?</font>

701
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,664
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck you!</font>

702
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,667
<font color="#ffff00">Look at me.</font>

703
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:01,561
<font color="#ffff00">What? I don't know
nothing about no diamond.</font>

704
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:03,646
<font color="#ffff00">The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,</font>

705
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:05,544
<font color="#ffff00">and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,</font>

706
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:09,557
<font color="#ffff00">all suggest that you do. Now, you
can give it to me, or I can give you</font>

707
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:12,758
<font color="#ffff00">to the man that diamond belongs to. But
trust me when I say, you're not gonna like</font>

708
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:15,001
<font color="#ffff00">what he's gonna do to ya.</font>

709
00:55:15,602 --> 00:55:18,129
<font color="#ffff00">Now, hand it over.</font>

710
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:21,131
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, not gonna happen.</font>

711
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:24,728
<font color="#ffff00">- Come again?
- I said I can't.</font>

712
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,378
<font color="#ffff00">- One more time.
- I can't give it to you.</font>

713
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:30,223
<font color="#ffff00">- Why not?
- Because I ate it, okay?</font>

714
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,643
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

715
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:42,122
<font color="#ffff00">What are we even doing here?</font>

716
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,028
<font color="#ffff00">There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.</font>

717
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,671
<font color="#ffff00">This way,</font>

718
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:50,125
<font color="#ffff00">or this way.</font>

719
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,647
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I thought.
Also, I'm outta groceries.</font>

720
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:02,053
<font color="#ffff00">So, how long you been
a mercenary?</font>

721
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,321
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, where did you get...</font>

722
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:06,586
<font color="#ffff00">You're so busy
looking at my right hand,</font>

723
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:08,569
<font color="#ffff00">you haven't even
thought about my left...</font>

724
00:56:08,649 --> 00:56:11,051
<font color="#ffff00">Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.</font>

725
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:17,171
<font color="#ffff00">I'll have to learn that one.</font>

726
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:19,662
<font color="#ffff00">Can we get this?</font>

727
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:21,789
<font color="#ffff00">You're not gonna try
to run, are you?</font>

728
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:24,302
<font color="#ffff00">Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,</font>

729
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:27,679
<font color="#ffff00">I figure I'm better off with the person
who's not gonna cut me open.</font>

730
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,651
<font color="#ffff00">Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.</font>

731
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:33,175
<font color="#ffff00">I do not care
that you're a kid.</font>

732
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:37,758
<font color="#ffff00">I saw that.</font>

733
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,754
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?</font>

734
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:44,310
<font color="#ffff00">I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,</font>

735
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,822
<font color="#ffff00">you're making bank,
you have your own business.</font>

736
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:52,639
<font color="#ffff00">How'd you do it? Come on, tell me.
Woman to woman.</font>

737
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,674
<font color="#ffff00">Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.</font>

738
00:56:56,754 --> 00:56:58,687
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, how do I be like you?</font>

739
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:02,315
<font color="#ffff00">Well, except for the crazy
part. But other than that.</font>

740
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:05,776
<font color="#ffff00">Number one, no one is like me.</font>

741
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,831
<font color="#ffff00">If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.</font>

742
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:13,710
<font color="#ffff00">Become a psychiatrist, work in an
asylum. Fall in love with your patient,</font>

743
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,775
<font color="#ffff00">break said patient out of said asylum.
Begin a life of crime.</font>

744
00:57:16,855 --> 00:57:18,861
<font color="#ffff00">Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.</font>

745
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,821
<font color="#ffff00">Get arrested by the Batman.</font>

746
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:22,749
<font color="#ffff00">Go back to jail, get out of
jail with a bomb on your neck.</font>

747
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:24,647
<font color="#ffff00">Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail</font>

748
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:26,784
<font color="#ffff00">before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman</font>

749
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,173
<font color="#ffff00">and going out on your own.</font>

750
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:34,885
<font color="#ffff00">Number two...
Six bucks for tap water</font>

751
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:38,855
<font color="#ffff00">with a fucking cucumber stick in it?
That's crazy.</font>

752
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,226
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not shopping
at this store.</font>

753
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,897
<font color="#ffff00">I'm robbing this store.
Consider this your first lesson.</font>

754
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:51,151
<font color="#ffff00">Paying is for dummies.</font>

755
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:58,667
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

756
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,749
<font color="#ffff00">Move it!</font>

757
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:07,766
<font color="#ffff00">Whoops. Ah...</font>

758
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:12,316
<font color="#ffff00">This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.</font>

759
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:16,767
<font color="#ffff00">Lotus flower!</font>

760
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,925
<font color="#ffff00">- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.</font>

761
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:21,719
<font color="#ffff00">He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.</font>

762
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,920
<font color="#ffff00">He knows everything and everyone. Nothing
happens around here, let me tell you,</font>

763
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,393
<font color="#ffff00">without Doc knowing about it.
And he happens to be the only person</font>

764
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,811
<font color="#ffff00">who actually cares about me.</font>

765
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:33,730
<font color="#ffff00">- I do?
- Yes, you do.</font>

766
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,910
<font color="#ffff00">She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.</font>

767
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,746
<font color="#ffff00">Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.</font>

768
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,725
<font color="#ffff00">So you don't have
to taste his cooking.</font>

769
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,345
<font color="#ffff00">Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.</font>

770
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:50,214
<font color="#ffff00">- Everyone's looking for you. And you.
- We know.</font>

771
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:53,310
<font color="#ffff00">I'm telling you, if you want
boys to respect you,</font>

772
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,760
<font color="#ffff00">you have to show them
that you're serious.</font>

773
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:58,805
<font color="#ffff00">Blow something up.
Shoot someone.</font>

774
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,902
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.</font>

775
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:04,268
<font color="#ffff00">Shut that door. Lock it.</font>

776
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,802
<font color="#ffff00">Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?</font>

777
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:20,460
<font color="#ffff00">This place... Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.</font>

778
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,858
<font color="#ffff00">...is so fucking dope.</font>

779
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:27,445
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, shit. Is that
a hyena in a bathtub?</font>

780
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:30,886
<font color="#ffff00">I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.</font>

aren't you?</font>

782
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:37,955
<font color="#ffff00">Aren't you, my little baby?
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.</font>

Hey, I think you should see this.</font>

1051
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:43,356
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

1052
01:21:43,436 --> 01:21:45,733

<font color="#ffff00">No, they're not.</font>

1059
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:29,344
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what that means? That means
he's not just after the kid anymore.</font>

1060
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:33,473
<font color="#ffff00">He's after all of us. He's sure as hell
after me. I just robbed him.</font>

1061
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,946
<font color="#ffff00">You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.</font>

1062
01:22:37,338 --> 01:22:40,427
<font color="#ffff00">And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.</font>

1063
01:22:40,507 --> 01:22:44,012
<font color="#ffff00">So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths</font>

1064
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:47,378
<font color="#ffff00">and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,</font>

1065
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,313
<font color="#ffff00">- we're gonna have to work together.
- With you?</font>

We're gonna work together,</font>

1067

<font color="#ffff00">and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?</font>

1068
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,750
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1069

<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Okay.</font>

1070
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:11,310

- Yes!</font>

1071

some serious hardware.</font>

1072

1073
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:25,657
<font color="#ffff00">No. Not at all.</font>

1074
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:29,877
<font color="#ffff00">We're dead.
We're fucking dead.</font>

1075
01:23:29,932 --> 01:23:33,463
<font color="#ffff00">That slimy jizznozzle! I can't believe
he took it all! - We're fucked.</font>

1076
01:23:33,544 --> 01:23:35,988
<font color="#ffff00">- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.</font>

1077
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,459
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1078
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:59,925
<font color="#ffff00">Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.</font>

1079
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:04,941
<font color="#ffff00">I have funded you.
I've protected you.</font>

1080

and kept you outta jail.</font>

1081
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,802
<font color="#ffff00">Well, now it's time
to say thank you.</font>

1082
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:19,046
<font color="#ffff00">Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.</font>

1083
01:24:19,543 --> 01:24:23,030
<font color="#ffff00">Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.</font>

1084
01:24:23,421 --> 01:24:25,834
<font color="#ffff00">The rest you can kill.</font>

1085
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,472
<font color="#ffff00">Dope.</font>

1086
01:24:34,473 --> 01:24:38,032
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.
Sentimental value. Try this.</font>

1087
01:24:40,468 --> 01:24:43,088
<font color="#ffff00">- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.</font>

1088
01:24:43,138 --> 01:24:45,403
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.</font>

1089
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:47,509
<font color="#ffff00">We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.</font>

1090
01:24:47,589 --> 01:24:49,960
<font color="#ffff00">- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

1091
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:53,504
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?</font>

1092
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:57,248
<font color="#ffff00">It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.</font>

1093
01:24:57,297 --> 01:25:00,426
<font color="#ffff00">- Love this chick. She's got rage issues.
- I don't have rage issues.</font>

the catharsis we hope for.</font>

that people are scared of you.</font>

1182
01:35:49,263 --> 01:35:51,634
<font color="#ffff00">Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.</font>

1183
01:35:57,134 --> 01:35:59,641
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm the one
they should be scared of.</font>

1184
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:02,163
<font color="#ffff00">Not you, and not Mr. J.</font>

1185
01:36:02,243 --> 01:36:05,625
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.</font>

1186
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:15,171
<font color="#ffff00">Shit.</font>

1187
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:19,178
<font color="#ffff00">- That was super embarrassing.
- Hmm. Sure was.</font>

1188
01:36:19,259 --> 01:36:23,537
<font color="#ffff00">You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.</font>

1189
01:36:24,304 --> 01:36:26,602
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, kid.</font>

1190
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:30,616
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.</font>

1191
01:36:32,155 --> 01:36:34,157
<font color="#ffff00">For what it's worth,</font>

1192
01:36:35,127 --> 01:36:38,603
<font color="#ffff00">you made me want to be
a less terrible person.</font>

1193
01:36:39,244 --> 01:36:40,207
<font color="#ffff00">Ew.</font>

1194
01:36:40,287 --> 01:36:44,086
<font color="#ffff00">If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.</font>

1195
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:48,079
<font color="#ffff00">- Excuse me!
- I stole something from you.</font>

1196
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:51,248
<font color="#ffff00">- You slippery-fingered little turd.
- I took your ring.</font>

1197
01:36:51,328 --> 01:36:53,522
<font color="#ffff00">My ring?</font>

1198
01:36:55,332 --> 01:36:57,334
<font color="#ffff00">Dope.</font>

1199
01:37:17,143 --> 01:37:19,971
<font color="#ffff00">- Cass! Harley!
- We're okay.</font>

1200
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,161
<font color="#ffff00">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

1201
01:37:26,266 --> 01:37:28,578
<font color="#ffff00">- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1202
01:37:28,587 --> 01:37:32,588
<font color="#ffff00">- Good. Fuck that guy.
- Yeah. Tacos?</font>

1203
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:36,288
<font color="#ffff00">No, but seriously.
You were very impressive with that bow.</font>

1204
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:39,124
<font color="#ffff00">- Very impressive.
- It's a crossbow.</font>

1205
01:37:39,204 --> 01:37:41,292
<font color="#ffff00">- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Morning margaritas!</font>

1206
01:37:41,372 --> 01:37:43,096
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you. I got you.</font>

1207
01:37:43,176 --> 01:37:46,150
<font color="#ffff00">- You drink, right, kid?
- I don't think so.</font>

1208
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,283
<font color="#ffff00">And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.</font>

1209
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:49,334
<font color="#ffff00">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

1210
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,261
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, great name.
- Wow.</font>

1211
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:55,158
<font color="#ffff00">Um... I really like
how you were able</font>

1212
01:37:55,238 --> 01:37:57,713
<font color="#ffff00">to kick so high
in those tight pants.</font>

1213
01:37:57,776 --> 01:38:00,288
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, that is cool.
- Thanks.</font>

1214
01:38:00,368 --> 01:38:03,594
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for the car.</font>

1215
01:38:04,341 --> 01:38:06,210
<font color="#ffff00">You're welcome.</font>

1216
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:10,642
<font color="#ffff00">Kid, if that burrito doesn't
make you shit, I don't know what will.</font>

1217
01:38:12,234 --> 01:38:14,235
<font color="#ffff00">Give me a minute.</font>

1218
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:16,167
<font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

1219
01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:18,597
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

1220
01:38:19,985 --> 01:38:22,150
<font color="#ffff00">I've given her prune juice,
laxatives.</font>

1221
01:38:22,156 --> 01:38:24,241
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.</font>

1222
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:26,363
<font color="#ffff00">And you know what?
I owe you an apology.</font>

1223
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:28,324
<font color="#ffff00">Me?</font>

1224
01:38:29,102 --> 01:38:31,848
<font color="#ffff00">I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.</font>

1225
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:35,679
<font color="#ffff00">I'm used to it.</font>

1226
01:38:35,762 --> 01:38:39,082
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.</font>

1227
01:38:40,703 --> 01:38:44,054
<font color="#ffff00">- Ladies.
- Have fun with that.</font>

1228
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:47,162
<font color="#ffff00">So, what now?</font>

1229
01:38:47,699 --> 01:38:50,726
<font color="#ffff00">Sionis is gone, but it's just a matter
of time before some other asshole</font>

1230
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:53,604
<font color="#ffff00">- tries to finish what he started.
- Right.</font>

1231
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:57,025
<font color="#ffff00">We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.</font>

1232
01:38:57,646 --> 01:39:00,725
<font color="#ffff00">Does she always talk like the cop in
a bad '80s movie, or is that just me?</font>

1233
01:39:00,805 --> 01:39:03,655
<font color="#ffff00">- Fuck you. And fuck you.
- What?</font>

1234
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:07,585
<font color="#ffff00">- I mean, we were amazing there.
- Yeah! Hell yeah!</font>

1235
01:39:07,665 --> 01:39:10,630
<font color="#ffff00">I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.</font>

1236
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:12,705
<font color="#ffff00">- Thank you.
- Right.</font>

1237
01:39:12,785 --> 01:39:14,787
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa. Whoa, whoa!</font>

1238
01:39:16,746 --> 01:39:19,811
<font color="#ffff00">- She stole my fucking car!
- What?</font>

1239
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:25,649
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm sorry.
- I know what you're thinking.</font>

1240
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:28,604
<font color="#ffff00">You think I'm a dick
after all that.</font>

1241
01:39:28,684 --> 01:39:31,763
<font color="#ffff00">But you heard what the cop
said. Sionis is gone.</font>

1242
01:39:31,843 --> 01:39:37,196
<font color="#ffff00">And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.</font>

1243
01:39:37,796 --> 01:39:41,585
<font color="#ffff00">Montoya's boss picked up
the gangbangers at the Booby Trap.</font>

1244
01:39:41,665 --> 01:39:44,608
<font color="#ffff00">And took all the credit
while he was at it.</font>

1245
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:46,690
<font color="#ffff00">Again.</font>

1246
01:39:51,674 --> 01:39:54,742
<font color="#ffff00">It was the kick in the balls she needed
to see that she had nothing to prove</font>

1247
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,119
<font color="#ffff00">to those blowhard assholes.</font>

1248
01:39:57,710 --> 01:40:00,112
<font color="#ffff00">She quit the same day.</font>

1249
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:06,711
<font color="#ffff00">We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</font>

1250
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:09,266
<font color="#ffff00">And Huntress
got her family money back.</font>

1251
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:13,797
<font color="#ffff00">She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.</font>

1252
01:40:16,685 --> 01:40:20,099
<font color="#ffff00">They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.</font>

1253
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:23,320
<font color="#ffff00">I call them
dorky little do-gooders.</font>

1254
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:29,836
<font color="#ffff00">The rock itself was worth a
chunk of change, so I pawned it.</font>

1255
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:32,630
<font color="#ffff00">And I invested the cash
in a little startup</font>

1256
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:34,712
<font color="#ffff00">making waves in the East End.</font>

1257
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:39,793
<font color="#ffff00">Oh! And I found Bruce.</font>

1258
01:40:39,873 --> 01:40:42,659
<font color="#ffff00">He was wandering
around Chinatown.</font>

1259
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:46,257
<font color="#ffff00">I guess it proves the theory that
hyenas really do have nine lives.</font>

1260
01:41:06,814 --> 01:41:10,175
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.</font>

1261
01:41:10,723 --> 01:41:12,725
<font color="#ffff00">Call me a softy.</font>

1262
01:41:13,726 --> 01:41:15,728
<font color="#ffff00">I dare ya.</font>
